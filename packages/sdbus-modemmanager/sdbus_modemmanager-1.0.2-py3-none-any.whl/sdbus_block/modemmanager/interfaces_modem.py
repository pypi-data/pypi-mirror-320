	Modem objects are exported in DBus with the following path base: /org/freedesktop/ModemManager1/Modems/#, where # 
	indicates a unique unsigned integer which identifies the object.
	
	The Modem objects will export a generic Modem interface which includes common features and actions applicable to 
	most modem types. This interface, among other actions, allows the management (creation, listing, deletion) of B
	earer objects which can then be used to request the modem to get in connected state.
	
	Modem objects will also export the generic Simple interface. This interface provides an easy access to the most 
	simple and common operations that may be performed with the modem, including connection and disconnection. Users 
	of the Simple interface do not need to take care of getting the modem registered, and they also don't need to manage 
	the creation of bearers themselves. All the logic required to get the modem connected or disconnected is handled 
	by the Simple interface.

	Modems with specific 3GPP and/or CDMA capabilities will export modem type specific interfaces, like the 3GPP 
	interface or the CDMA interface.
