The NMRAspecds package provides tools for handling experimental data obtained using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and is derived from the `ASpecD framework <https://docs.aspecd.de/>`_,  hence all data generated with the nmraspecds package are completely reproducible and have a complete history.

What is even better: Actual data processing and analysis no longer requires programming skills, but is as simple as writing a text file summarising all the steps you want to have been performed on your dataset(s) in an organised way. Curious? Have a look at the following example::

    format:
      type: ASpecD recipe
      version: '0.2'

    settings:
      default_package: nmraspecds

    datasets:
      - /path/to/first/dataset
      - /path/to/second/dataset

    tasks:
      - kind: processing
        type: Normalisation
        parameters:
          properties:
            kind: scan_number
      - kind: singleplot
        type: SinglePlotter1D
        properties:
          filename:
            - first_dataset.pdf
            - second_dataset.pdf

Features
========

A list of features:

* Fully reproducible processing and analysis of NMR data.

* Gap-less record of each processing/analysis step, including explicit and implicit parameters.

* Import of Bruker NMR data

* Generic representation of NMR data, independent of the original format.

* Datasets contain both, numerical data and all crucial metadata, a prerequisite for FAIR data.

* Generic plotting capabilities, easily extendable

* Report generation using pre-defined templates

* Recipe-driven data analysis, allowing tasks to be performed fully unattended in the background


And to make it even more convenient for users and future-proof:

* Open source project written in Python (>= 3.7)

* Developed mostly test-driven

* Extensive user and API documentation



Target audience
===============

The NMRAspecds package addresses scientists working with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data on a daily base and concerned with reproducibility. Due to being based on the ASpecD framework, the NMRAspecds package ensures reproducibility and---as much as possible---replicability of data processing, starting from recording data and ending with their final (graphical) representation, e.g., in a peer-reviewed publication. This is achieved by automatically creating a gap-less record of each operation performed on your data. If you do care about reproducibility and are looking for a system that helps you to achieve this goal, the NMRAspecds package may well be interesting for you.
