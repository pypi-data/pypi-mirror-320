# Athenea: Implementation of Transfusion based on Llama 3 architecture

This is still being worked on, there may be major improvements in the coming days.


## Installation via Pypi:

```bash
pip install Athenea
```

To use the latest versions you must install from the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rivera-ai/Athenea.git
cd Athenea
pip install .
```

IMPORTANT: We usually don't take more than 2 days to upload the most recent versions to Pypi
