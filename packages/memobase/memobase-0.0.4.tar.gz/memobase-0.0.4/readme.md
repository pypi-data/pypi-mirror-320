🌬️ **Does your AI forget your users?** 


> Memobase maintains long-term memory of your users, for your product.

🖼️ **Do you understand the customers that using your AI?** 

> Memobase offers accurate user profile, involving many aspects of your users: Age, Education, Interests, Opinions...
> 
> [Customize](./src/server/readme.md/#Customization) the aspects you want Memobase to collect.

⌛️ **Do you want users spend more time on your Apps?** 

> Memobase is working with some AI companion startups. They have observated increased chatting turns after adopting Memobase, leading to higher user retention and subscription rate.



## Get Started

1. [Start your Memobase Backend](./src/server/readme.md), you should have the below two things to continue:
   1. A project url. default to `http://localhost:8019` 

   2. A project token. default to `secret`

2. Install the Python SDK: `pip install memobase`

3. Get ready to remember your customers now:

### Make sure you're connected

 ```python
 from memobase import MemoBaseClient, ChatBlob
 
 mb = MemoBaseClient("http://localhost:8019", "secret")
 assert mb.ping()
 ```

### User CURD

```python
uid = mb.add_user({"any_key": "any_value"})
mb.update_user(uid, {"any_key": "any_value2"})
u = mb.get_user(uid)

print(u)
```

*Delete*: `mb.delete(uid)`

### Single User Data

> In Memobase, all types of data are blobs to a user that can insert, get and delete:

```python
messages = [
  {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Hello, I'm Gus",
  },
  {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Hi, nice to meet you, Gus!",
  }
]
bid = u.insert(ChatBlob(messages=messages))
print(u.get(bid))
```

*Delete*: `u.delete(bid)`.

### "Flush it moment"

```python
u.flush()
```

And what will you get?

```python
print(u.profile())
# [UserProfile(topic="basic_info", sub_topic="name", content="Gus"),...]
```

`u.profile()` will return a list of profiles that are learned from this user, including `topic`, `sub_topic` and `content`. As you insert more blobs, the profiles will become better.

<details>
<summary> Why need a flush?</summary>

In Memobase, we don't memoize users in [hot path](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/#writing-memories-in-the-hot-path). We use buffer zones for the recent inserted blobs.

When the buffer zone is too large (*e.g.* 1024 tokens) or idle for a long time (*e.g.* 1 hour), Memobase will flush the whole buffer into the memory. 
Or you can just manually decide when to flush (*e.g.* A chat session is closed in your App)
</details>



## Why/Where should I use Memobase?

### Remember the users 

By placing profiles into your AI (*e.g.* system prompt).

<details>
<summary>Demo</summary>


```python
PROFILES = "\n".join([p.describe for p in u.profile()])

print(PROFILES)
# basic_info: name - Gus
# basic_info: age - 25
# ...
# interest: foods - Mexican cuisine
# psychological: goals - Build something that maybe useful
# ...
```

</details>

### User analysis and tracking

Too much information is hidden in the conversations between users and AI, that's why you need a new data tracking method to record user preference and behavior.

<details>
<summary>Demo</summary>


```python
PROFILES = u.profile()

def under_age_30(p):
  return p.sub_topic == "age" and int(p.content) < 30

def love_cat(p):
  return p.topic == "interest" and p.sub_topic == "pets" and "cat" in p.content

is_user_under_30 = (
    len([p for p in profiles if under_age_30(p)]) > 0
)
is_user_love_cat = (
  len([p for p in profiles if love_cat(p)]) > 0
)                       
...
```
</details>

### Sell something to your customers.  

Not everyone is looking for Grammarly, it's always nice to sell something your users might want. 

<details>
<summary>Demo</summary>


```python
def pick_an_ad(profiles):
  work_titles = [p for p in profiles if p.topic=="work" and p.sub_topic=="title"]
  if not len(work_titles):
    return None
  wt = work_titles[0].content
  if wt == "Software Engineer":
    return "Deep Learning Stuff"
  elif wt == "some job":
    return "some ads"
  ...
```
