# Pygame-Engine

## Overview
Pygame-Engine is a lightweight, Unity-inspired game engine built using Python and Pygame. It provides a modular and extensible framework for 2D game development, including GameObjects, Components, Scene Management, Event Handling, and more.

---

## Features
- **GameObject System**: Modular entities with components like `Transform`, `SpriteRenderer`, and `Collider`.
- **Scene Management**: Easily manage and transition between game scenes.
- **Prefab System**: Save and instantiate reusable GameObject templates.
- **Event System**: Decoupled communication via a publish-subscribe model.
- **Input Manager**: Centralized input handling with customizable key bindings.
- **Scriptable Objects**: Reusable and serializable data containers for configurations and items.

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pygame-engine.git
   cd pygame-engine
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run an example:
   ```bash
   python examples/basic_game.py
   ```

---

## Usage

### GameObject System
Create GameObjects and add Components:
```python
from engine.game_object import GameObject
from engine.components import Transform, SpriteRenderer

player = GameObject("Player")
player_transform = player.add_component(Transform)
player_renderer = player.add_component(SpriteRenderer)
player_transform.position = [100, 100]
```

### Scene Management
Switch between scenes or reset the current scene:
```python
from engine.scene_manager import SceneManager
from engine.scene import Scene

main_scene = Scene("MainScene")
SceneManager.load_scene(main_scene)
SceneManager.reset_scene()
```

### Prefab System
Save and instantiate reusable prefabs:
```python
from engine.prefab_system import PrefabSystem

PrefabSystem.save_prefab("PlayerPrefab", "player_prefab.json", player)
new_player = PrefabSystem.instantiate_prefab("player_prefab.json")
```

### Event System
Publish and subscribe to events:
```python
from engine.event_system import EventBus

EventBus.subscribe("player_died", lambda score: print(f"Player died with score {score}"))
EventBus.publish("player_died", score=100)
```

### Input Manager
Bind keys to actions:
```python
from engine.input_manager import InputManager

InputManager.bind_action("jump", pygame.K_SPACE, "down")
InputManager.register_callback("jump", lambda: print("Jump!"))
```
