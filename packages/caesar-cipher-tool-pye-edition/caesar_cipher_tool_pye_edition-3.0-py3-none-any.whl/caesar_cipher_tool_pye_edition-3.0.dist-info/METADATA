1. It slices the alphabet from the index of shift then add the sliced part to the start of the alphabet
2. Find the index of every character in user input in the alphabet and append the character with the same index into the output. Add the character into the output if it doesn't exist in the alphabet.

## Functionalities
Encipher/Decipher text to/from Caesar Cipher. This have 2 modes:
1. Input from keyboard: Good for inputting short texts and quickly Encipher/Decipher them.
2. Input from file: Good for processing a large amount of text, result will be put into another file, you can input the file name you desire, or leave blank to use the default name (output.txt). You have to specify the directory for the output file in case you select this mode.

```

## Usage

cct
```

## Requirement(s)
1.  Python 3.x

## Note(s)
1. While the input from file mode support pretty much any file type, anything other than plain text files (*.txt,...) could cause the program to freeze up (e.g *.exe,...) so avoid inputting those.
