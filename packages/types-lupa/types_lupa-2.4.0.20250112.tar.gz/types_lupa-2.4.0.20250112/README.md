## Typing stubs for lupa

This is a [PEP 561](https://peps.python.org/pep-0561/)
type stub package for the [`lupa`](https://github.com/scoder/lupa) package.
It can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
[Pyre](https://pyre-check.org/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses `lupa`. This version of
`types-lupa` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`lupa==2.4.*`.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/lupa`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/lupa)
directory.

This package was tested with
mypy 1.14.1,
pyright 1.1.389,
and pytype 2024.10.11.
It was generated from typeshed commit
[`38d2fe81fee593468d0738f89a5b5101a86f4e53`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/38d2fe81fee593468d0738f89a5b5101a86f4e53).
