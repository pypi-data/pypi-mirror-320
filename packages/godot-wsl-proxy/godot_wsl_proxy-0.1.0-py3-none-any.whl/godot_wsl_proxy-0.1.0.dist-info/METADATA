# WSL2 to Windows Godot LSP proxy

When using Neovim from WSL and Godot from Windows - the LSP file paths are not compatible

This is the simple TCP proxy that mirrors requests that LSP protocol does (JSON RPC), finds and replaces paths both ways: from linux to windows and from windows to linux

It works as a separate server that LSP Client from your editor should connect to

This project is inspired by [godot-wsl-lsp](https://github.com/lucasecdb/godot-wsl-lsp) but basically does this proxying on a lower level and thanks to that it works very fast

# Installation

It is intended to be installed via pipx:

```shell
pipx install godot-wsl-proxy
```

(Not recommended) But you can do it via just pip and install it globally:

```shell
pip install --user godot-wsl-proxy
```

In future I plan to add this to Mason (for Neovim users)
