# Stocks Historical Library ðŸ“Š

A Python library to access historical stock data for NASDAQ and NYSE markets. This library simplifies fetching and formatting stock data using the [Stocks Historical API](https://github.com/mantey-github/stock-fetcher-api). It is designed for developers and data analysts who want to quickly retrieve and analyze stock data programmatically.

Library inspired by [Yahoo Historical](https://github.com/AndrewRPorter/yahoo-historical).

## Installation
Install the library via pip:
```bash
pip install stocks-historical
```

## Usage

#### **Import and Initialize**
You can use the `Nasdaq` or `Nyse` classes to fetch stock data:
```bash
from stocks_historical import Nasdaq, Nyse

# Fetch NASDAQ data
nasdaq_data = Nasdaq(symbol="AAPL", start="2023-01-03", end="2023-01-09")  # Start and end are dates (YYYY-MM-DD)
data = nasdaq_data.get_data()
print(data.head())

# Fetch NYSE data
nyse_data = Nyse(symbol="GE", start="2023-01-03")  # End is optional
data = nyse_data.get_data()
print(data.head())

```

**Output**:
The data is returned as a Pandas DataFrame with columns:

- `Date:` Timestamp of the record (in human-readable format).
- `Open:` Opening price of the stock.
- `High:` Highest price of the stock.
- `Low:` Lowest price of the stock.
- `Close:` Closing price of the stock.

**Example DataFrame:**
```bash
Fetched Data:
                 Date     Open     High     Low   Close
0 2023-01-03 01:00:00  130.280  130.900  124.17  125.07
1 2023-01-04 01:00:00  126.890  128.656  125.08  126.36
2 2023-01-05 01:00:00  127.130  127.770  124.76  125.02
3 2023-01-06 01:00:00  126.010  130.290  124.89  129.62
4 2023-01-09 01:00:00  130.465  133.410  129.89  130.15
```
