# Create a client with your API token
translator = SoyleApp("your-api-token")

# Translate text to text
translated_text = translator.text_translate(
    source_language="eng", target_language="kaz", text="Hello, world!"
)
print("Translated text:", translated_text)

# Translate text to audio
audio_base16 = translator.audio_translate(
    source_language="eng", target_language="kaz", text="Hello, world!", voice="female"
)

# Save the audio to a file
with open("output_audio.wav", "wb") as audio_file:
    audio_file.write(bytes.fromhex(audio_base16))
print("Audio saved as output_audio.wav")
