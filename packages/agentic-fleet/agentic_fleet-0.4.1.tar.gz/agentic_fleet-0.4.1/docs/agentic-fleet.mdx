## Technical Details

### Agent Communication

Agents communicate through a message bus system:
```python
async def send_message(self, recipient: str, content: dict):
    await self.message_bus.publish(
        topic=recipient,
        message=Message(
            sender=self.name,
            content=content,
            timestamp=datetime.now()
        )
    )
```

### Task Processing

Tasks are processed through a pipeline:
```python
async def process_task(self, task: Task):
    # Task decomposition
    subtasks = self.decompose_task(task)
    
    # Agent assignment
    assignments = self.assign_agents(subtasks)
    
    # Parallel execution
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        *[agent.execute(subtask) 
          for agent, subtask in assignments]
    )
    
    # Result aggregation
    return self.aggregate_results(results)
```
