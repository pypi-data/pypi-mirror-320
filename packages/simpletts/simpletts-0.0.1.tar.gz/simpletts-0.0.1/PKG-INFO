# SimpleTTS

A lightweight Python library for text-to-speech synthesis that makes it easy to use and switch between different TTS models.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is under active development and APIs may change. Not recommended for production use yet.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Simple, intuitive API
- ðŸ”„ Easy model switching
- ðŸŽ¯ Focus on ease of use
- ðŸ“¦ Minimal dependencies
- ðŸ”Œ Extensible architecture

## Installation

Install the latest release from PyPI:

```bash
pip install simpletts
```

Or get the latest version from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/fakerybakery/simpletts
```

## Quick Start

```python
from simpletts.models.xtts import XTTS
import soundfile as sf

tts = XTTS(device="auto")
# Note: XTTS is licensed under the CPML license which restricts commercial use.

array, sr = tts.synthesize("Hello, world!", ref="sample.wav")

sf.write("output.wav", array, sr)
```

## Supported Models

| Model | License | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| XTTS | CPML | High-quality multilingual TTS with voice cloning capabilities |
| Kokoro | Apache-2.0 | Fast and lightweight English TTS with voice cloning |

## Roadmap

**Models**

- [x] XTTS - Production-ready multilingual TTS
- [x] Kokoro - StyleTTS 2-based English TTS without voice cloning
- [ ] StyleTTS 2 - Fast and efficient zero-shot voice cloning
- [ ] F5-TTS - Superb voice cloning and naturalness, but slower and less stable

**Features**

- [x] Simple Python API for easy integration
- [ ] Command-line interface for quick testing and batch processing
- [ ] REST API and web interface for remote access
- [ ] Model benchmarking tools
- [ ] Batch processing support
- [ ] Audio post-processing options
