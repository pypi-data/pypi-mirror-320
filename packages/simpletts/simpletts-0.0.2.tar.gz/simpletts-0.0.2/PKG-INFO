# SimpleTTS

A lightweight Python library for text-to-speech synthesis that makes it easy to use and switch between different TTS models.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is under active development and APIs may change. Not recommended for production use yet.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Simple and intuitive API - get started in minutes
- ðŸ”„ No model lock-in - switch models with just a few lines of code
- ðŸŽ¯ Focus on ease of use - a single API for all models
- ðŸ“¦ Minimal dependencies - one package for all models
- ðŸ”Œ Extensible architecture - easily add new models

## Installation

Install the latest release from PyPI:

```bash
pip install simpletts
```

Or get the latest version from source:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/fakerybakery/simpletts
```

## Quick Start

```python
from simpletts.models.xtts import XTTS
import soundfile as sf

tts = XTTS(device="auto")
# Note: XTTS is licensed under the CPML license which restricts commercial use.

array, sr = tts.synthesize("Hello, world!", ref="sample.wav")

sf.write("output.wav", array, sr)
```

## Supported Models

| Model | License | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| XTTS | CPML | High-quality multilingual TTS with voice cloning capabilities |
| Kokoro | Apache-2.0 | Fast and lightweight English TTS with voice cloning |
| F5-TTS | CC BY-NC | Superb voice cloning and naturalness, but slower and less stable |
| Parler TTS | Apache-2.0 | Describe a voice with a text prompt |

> [!NOTE]
> If you are trying to install Parler TTS, you may run into dependency conflicts or other issues. Parler TTS is not officially supported by the SimpleTTS project, please do not report issues to the SimpleTTS project if you run into issues.
> 
> Parler TTS is not officially available on PyPI, so we cannot add it as a required dependency due to PyPI security requirements. We have published several unofficial packages for Parler TTS and its dependencies to PyPI, however this is not guaranteed to work.
>
> If you run into issues, please try running `pip uninstall parler-tts` and then `pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/parler-tts`.

## Roadmap

## License

This project is licensed under the **BSD-3-Clause** license. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for more details.

While SimpleTTS itself is open source and can be used commercially, please note that some supported models have different licensing terms:

- XTTS is licensed under CPML which restricts commercial use
- Kokoro is licensed under Apache-2.0 which allows commercial use
- Other models may have their own licensing requirements

Note that SimpleTTS **does not** use the GPL-licensed `phonemizer` library. Instead, it uses the BSD-licensed `openphonemizer` alternative. While this may slightly reduce pronunciation accuracy, it's license is compatible with the BSD-3-Clause license of SimpleTTS.
