<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!--
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)
-->

Pyrite is a framework for eliminating much of the boilerplate of setting up a pygame project and getting running, while encouraging good project architecture with proper seperation of responsibilities among game elements. It includes several built-in systems to get development up and going.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Pyrite is written in pure python, with no system dependencies, and should be OS-agnostic.

### Installation

Pyrite can be installed from the [PyPI][pypi-url] using [pip][pip-url]:

```sh
pip install pyrite-framework
```

and can be imported for use with:
```python
import pyrite
```

Pyrite additionally is built for pygame-ce, which must also be installed.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

At its core, Pyrite is built around a single main class: the Game class.
Game is useable as-is in its default state, or it can be subclassed to allow for more specific behaviors.

### Using Game

A game can be started in multiple ways.

1. Traditional way

```python
import pyrite

my_game = pyrite.Game()  # Creating with default settings
# ----------------------
#
# Game setup stuff here
#
# ----------------------
my_game.main()
```

This will create a window with a black background, at the default size (800x600), with a caption of "Game"

Keep in mind, anything after calling main() will be on hold until after the game stops running.

2. Context Manager

Alternatively, we can use python's ```with``` syntax to create a game.

```python
import pyrite

with pyrite.Game() as my_game:
    # ----------------------
    #
    # Game setup stuff here
    #
    # ----------------------
```

As with the above example, this will start a game with default settings. As a context manager, Game will start itself once the context ends.

Using context manager syntax offers a couple benefits.
1. Avoids needing to manually call main().

    This is minor, but it's an additional step that needs to be minded otherwise.

2. Indentation helps make it clear what code is being used to set up the game.

3. Errors are captured.

    Any error that occurs during the set up will be captured by the context manager, and Game has a setting to suppress these errors.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Game Settings

Game has several data classes that hold information for it. You can construct the yourself and pass them to the game instance, or you can pass their parameters as keywords into the Game constructor.

```python
# This:
display_settings = DisplaySettings((400, 300))
with Game(display_settings=display_settings) as my_game:
    ...

# Is the same as this
with Game(resolution=(400, 300)) as my_game:
    ...
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Loop Phases

A game is built around a loop, and that loop has certain phases. The pyrite game loop offers these phases:

1. Events: The pygame event queue is processed

2. Const_update: Runs at a fixed rate, regardless of frame rate. Useful for time-invariant things, like physics.

3. Pre_update: Runs earlier than the main update phase.

4. Update: Main update phase. Most logic is run here.

5. Post-update: Runs after the main update phase.

6. Render: For drawing to the screen.

The basic Game class will call each of the phases after Events on all active Entities and Renderables, but also has these available as methods to allow for more specific behavior when subclassed.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Entities and Renderables

These are the core feature of Pyrite. All game objects should inherit from at least one of these. They allow you to define behaviors, and render out images onto the screen.

#### Entity

An entity is any object that has behavior. They can be typical objects, like an enemy, or obstacle, or they can be systems and services, like a physics service. To use, simply subclass Entity, and overwrite at least one of the four update-phase methods. Then, when the entity is created, it will automatically have those methods called each frame.

```python

class MyEntity(Entity):

    def __init__(self, game_instance=None, enabled=True):
        super().__init__(game_instance, enabled)
        self.position: tuple[int, int] = (0, 0)


    def update(self, delta_time: float):
        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()
        x = y = 0
        if keys[pygame.K_w]:
            y -= 1
        if keys[pygame.K_s]:
            y += 1
        if keys[pygame.K_a]:
            x -= 1
        if keys[pygame.K_d]:
            x += 1
        self.move((x, y))

    
    def move(self, direction: tuple[int, int]):
        self.position = (
            self.position[0] + direction[0], self.position[1] + direction[1]
        )
```

This will create a simple entity that will move with the WASD keys. Note, however, that it does not show anything on screen, as it is not renderable.


#### Renderables

Renderables are anything that needs to be drawn to the screen. They must implement the render method, which must return a ready-to-draw surface, and the get_rect method, which returns a pygame Rectangle, with the position and size of the renderable.
Classes can inherit from both Entity and Renderable, to allow them to both be drawn and have behavior.

```python
class MyRenderable(Renderable):

    # __init__ here

    def get_rect(self) -> pygame.Rect:
        return pygame.Rect(100, 50, 10, 10)

    def render(self, delta_time: float):
        surface = Surface((10, 10))
        surface.fill(Color("fuchsia"))
        return surface
```

This will draw a small fuchsia square at a world position of 100, 50.

#### UI Elements

There's a special layer in the the render system, the UI layer. Renderables in the UI layer are always drawn in screen space, not world space.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Forget About Screen Space

It's all about world space, now.

Pyrite features a camera system as part of its default renderer. Cameras are moveable and zoomable, and automatically ignore any renderables they can't see, speeding up your game when items are offscreen.

You can even have multiple cameras, rendered to different parts of the screen!

Renderables have layers and draw indexes to ensure that everything is drawn in the desired order. You can even add additional layers, and have cameras ignore layers, as needed.

Cameras are even optional. Pyrite will treat your world space just like screen space, if you don't want/need cameras for your project.

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

- [ ] Add a world space conversion for clicking.
- [ ] (Eternal) Improve the renderer. Faster rendering means more renderables!
