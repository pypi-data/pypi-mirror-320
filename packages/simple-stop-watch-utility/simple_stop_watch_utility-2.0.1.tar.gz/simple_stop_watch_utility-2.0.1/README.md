# StopWatch
## simple-stop-watch-utility
A simple timer utility for recording the run time of other processes.

The package came about because a basic search of PyPI, using the term stop-watch, came up with absolutely nothing. It was only after I tried to publish it, using the name stop-watch, that I found there are hundreds. After being rejected by PyPi, because *The name 'stop-watch' is too similar to an existing project*, I searched using the name stopwatch, and found many that could have saved me *_a lot_* of time. Thanks PyPI. Why I chose to put the hyphen in, I cannot remember, as it was a long time ago, but I think it just felt more natural, in a coding environment. (Maybe somebody there could connect the approval algorithm to the search box.)
Anyhoo, I've built it now and I've got used to the way it works. It's really only meant for logging/reporting, so all outputs are simple string formatted date & time stamps, but if you want to know how long a process has taken, it couldn't be easier.<br>
You simply kick it off at the start of your application, then you can drop in as many lap or interval timers as you like.<br>
I will add some proper instructions soon, but as I'm not expecting anyone outside my immediate circle to adopt this, that's not a high priority. But if you do want to give it a try, and would like some guidance, I'm only an email away.
