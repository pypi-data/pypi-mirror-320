# softpy

This is the GitHub repository for the **softpy** library, a Python library for soft computing, currently focused on fuzzy systems and evolutionary computing.
It was originally developed for educational purposes within th Laboratory class of the Fuzzy Systems and Evolutionary Computing course, offered
at the 2nd year of the Bachelor of Science in Artificial Intelligence at University of Milano-Bicocca.

The aim of the library is to provide a practical implementation of the main ideas in soft computing, specifically fuzzy systems and evolutionary computing.

THe library is released as open-source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/AndreaCampagner/softpy) and [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/softpy/).
