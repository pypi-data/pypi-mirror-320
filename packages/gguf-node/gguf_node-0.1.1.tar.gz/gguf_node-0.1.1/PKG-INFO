**üê∑üê∑üìÑ for the latest update, gguf-connector deployment copy is now attached to the node itself; don't need to clone it to site-packages; and, as the default setting in comfyui is sufficient; no dependencies needed right away; no extra step anymore**

- drag clip or encoder(s) to text_encoders folder (./ComfyUI/models/text_encoders)
- drag controlnet adapter(s), if any, to controlnet folder (./ComfyUI/models/controlnet)

- drag any generated output file (i.e., picture, video, etc.; which contains the workflow metadata) to the activated browser

#### simulator
- design your own prompt; or
- generate a random prompt/descriptor by the [simulator](https://prompt.calcuis.us) (though it might not be applicable for all)

#### convertor (new feature: convert safetensors to gguf)
- drag safetensors file(s) to diffusion_models folder (./ComfyUI/models/diffusion_models)
- choose the last option from the gguf menu: `GGUF Convertor (Alpha)`
- select your safetensors model inside the box; don't need to connect anything; it works independently
