要約
---------------------------------

  FreeBSD 日本語マニュアルページャー


概要
---------------------------------

  manjpfbはpython3で動作するFreeBSD日本語マニュアルページャーです。
  このプログラムはデータを保存せず、その都度ごとにダウンロードをします。
  pythonスクリプトで動作していることから、将来的には多くのOSで動作すれば良いと考えています。
  多くのオペレーティングシステムでFreeBSD日本語マニュアルを読めるようになります。
  FreeBSD日本語マニュアルの中には完全に翻訳されていないものがありますが、現在のところ仕様です。
  ドキュメントの翻訳に全ての責任を負わないことに注意してください。

SUMMARY
---------------------------------

  FreeBSD Japanese-Man Pager.

SYNOPSIS
--------------------------------

  | manjpfb [ \--version | \--help ]

QUICK START
--------------------------------

Run on python pypi.

.. code-block:: console

  $ python3.xx -m pip install manjpfb

DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------

  manjpfb is pager of FreeBSD Japanese man using Python3.
  The program does not store man-data and download it with each request.
  Since it is a Python script, it is expected to run on many Operating Systems in the future.
  We can read the FreeBSD Japanese man on many Operating Systems.
  There is man-data that is not fully translated, but this is currently by design.
  Please note that I do not take full responsibility for the translation of the documents.
