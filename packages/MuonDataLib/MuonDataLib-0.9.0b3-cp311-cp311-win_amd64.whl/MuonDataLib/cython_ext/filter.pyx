    Method for calculating which frames filters belong to.
    This assumes that all data is in order.
    It uses a binary search to find the index of the left bound of the bin
    containing the desired value. Since the filter times are in order
    the next search can have a start value of equal to the index found for
    the previous filter. Similarly the first end filter must be after the
    start for the first filter.
