    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "In computer science, [reference counting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting) is a programming technique of storing the number of references, pointers, or handles to a resource, such as an object, a block of memory, disk space, and others. \n",
    "\n",
    "This `refcount` package is primarily for managing resources in native libraries, written for instance in C++, from Python. While it boils down to \"simply\" maintaining a set of counters, **it is deceptively complicated to do so properly** and not end up with memory leaks or crashes. This package offers structured options for reliably managing external native resources. Surprisingly I could not locate an existing python package doing just what I needed. Other use cases requiring reference counting, aside from native library resources, may benefit from reusing and extending classes in `refcount`.\n",
    "\n",
    "While `refcount` may be used in a variety of contexts, it evolved from use cases needing a Python wrapper around native libraries featuring a C API with opaque pointers (void*), using [cffi](https://cffi.readthedocs.io) for interoperability. This document will not list the many other ways this can be done, nor compare to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Interfacing with a C API\n",
    "\n",
    "`C` is still the \"lingua franca' of in-memory interoperability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a C++ library with objects and a C API. The example is contrived for the sake of simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "#define TEST_DOG_PTR  testnative::dog*\n",
    "#define TEST_OWNER_PTR  testnative::owner*\n",
    "#define TEST_COUNTED_PTR  testnative::reference_counter*\n",
    "\n",
    "testnative::dog* create_dog();\n",
    "testnative::owner* create_owner(testnative::dog* d);\n",
    "void say_walk(testnative::owner* owner);\n",
    "void release(testnative::reference_counter* obj);\n",
    "// etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "From the outside of the library the API is exported with opaque pointers `void*` (C structs pointers and native C99 types could be handled too).\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "void* create_dog();\n",
    "void* create_owner(void* d);\n",
    "void say_walk(void* owner);\n",
    "void release(void* obj);\n",
    "// etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A user experience in Python should be something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dog = Dog()\n",
    "owner = DogOwner(dog)\n",
    "owner.say_walk()\n",
    "print(dog.position)\n",
    "dog = None # the \"native dog\" is still alive though, as the owner incremented the ref count. Otherwise, we could have a dreaded segmentation fault.\n",
    "owner = None\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We want python objects and functions hiding the low level details close to the C API, in particular the end user should avoiding managing native memory via `release` C API calls, piggybacking the python reference counting instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A real-world use case\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a more compelling story. `refcount` is used to surface to Python a library to manage ensemble, [uchronia] \n"
