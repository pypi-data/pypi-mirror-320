> [!Warning] 
> **This project is still in an early phase of development.**
>
> The [python API](https://c-star.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html) is not yet stable, and some aspects of the schema for the [blueprint](https://c-star.readthedocs.io/en/latest/terminology.html#term-blueprint) will likely evolve. 
> Therefore whilst you are welcome to try out using the package, we cannot yet guarantee backwards compatibility. 
We expect to reach a more stable version in Q1 2025.
>
> To see which systems C-Star has been tested on so far, see [Supported Systems](https://c-star.readthedocs.io/en/latest/machines.html).

# Installation

## Installation from GitHub

To obtain the latest development version, clone [this repository](https://github.com/CWorthy-ocean/C-Star):

```
git clone https://github.com/CWorthy-ocean/C-Star.git
cd C-Star
``` 

Next, install **one** of the following conda environments, depending on whether you are working on a supported HPC system (environment management by Linux Environment Modules) or a generic machine like a laptop (environment managed by conda):

```
conda env create -f ci/environment_hpc.yml  # conda environment for supported HPC system
# conda env create -f ci/environment.yml  # conda environment for generic machine 
```

Activate the conda environment:
```
conda activate cstar_env
```

Finally, install `C-Star` in the same environment:
```
pip install -e .
``` 

## Run the tests

Before running the tests, you can activate the conda environment created in the previous section:
```
conda activate cstar_env
```

Check the installation of `C-Star` has worked by running the test suite
```
cd C-Star
pytest
```
