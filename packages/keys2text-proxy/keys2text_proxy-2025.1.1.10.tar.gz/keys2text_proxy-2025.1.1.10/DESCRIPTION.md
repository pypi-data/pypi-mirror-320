Keys2Text Proxy is a Python-based application that acts as an **API proxy server**, 
offering **OpenAI API compatibility** while seamlessly routing requests to multiple 
AI providers using your own API keys. 

One can use the familiar OpenAI endpoints in your existing code and effortlessly switch 
between providers:
Anthropic, Google AI Studio, Groq, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, LM Studio, Ollama, or OpenAI itself
... **simply by configuring your API keys** in .env or environment variables (export/setx).

This app is intended to be installed and used locally on your computer and works 
nicely when using novelcrafter.
