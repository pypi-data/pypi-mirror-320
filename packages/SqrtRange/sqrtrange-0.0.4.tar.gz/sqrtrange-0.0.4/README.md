# SqrtRange


SqrtRange is a simple python library used to generate Square root of numbers in a certain range.

This can be helpful, if, for example, you need this


# How can i use it?
It's actually really simple

Here is what you will need to use:

`SqrtRange.Calculate(firstnumber, secondnumber, logFile, doClearLogFile)`

Firstnumber and Secondnumber are **integers**, these will indicate the range

LogFile is a **string**, it's where to log the numbers to

doClearLogFile instead is a **boolean**, it's used if you want to clear the log file or not
