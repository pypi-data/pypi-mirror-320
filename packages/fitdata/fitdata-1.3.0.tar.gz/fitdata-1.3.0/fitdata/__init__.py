FitData Package
===============

FitData provides tools for analyzing and managing health-related data and fitness goals.
It includes core calculations such as BMI (Body Mass Index), BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate),
and TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure). The package also supports advanced features
like caloric adjustments, macronutrient management, and weekly progression tracking.

Main Features:
- `FitData`: The main class for managing user data.
- `basic_calc`: Core calculations for BMI, BMR, and TDEE.
- `other_calc`: Advanced calculations for caloric adjustments, macros, and duration estimation.
- `weeklyprogression`: Tracks weekly progression and provides feedback.
- `interfaces`: Defines structured types for user input data.

Dependencies:
This package requires `numpy` and `pandas` to function properly.
