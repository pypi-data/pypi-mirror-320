# Luvex

Luvex is a Python package for implementing machine learning models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and more.

## Installation

You can install `luvex` from PyPI using pip:

```bash
pip install luvex


## Testing Linear Regression

import numpy as np
from luvex import Linearregression  # Import your model

def test_linear_regression():
    X_train = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    y_train = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    X_test = np.array([2])
    
    model = Linearregression()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    
    assert np.allclose(predictions, np.array([2]))  # Test if prediction matches expected value

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_linear_regression()
    print("All tests passed for Linearregression")

## Testing Logistic Regression

import numpy as np
from luvex import Logisticregression  # Import your model

def test_logistic_regression():
    X_train = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]])
    y_train = np.array([0, 1, 0])
    X_test = np.array([[2, 3]])

    model = Logisticregression(learn_rate=0.01, n_iter=1000)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    #assert predictions[0] >= 0  # Corrected to index into the first value of the array


if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_logistic_regression()
    print("All tests passed for Logisticregression")

## Test KNN

import numpy as np
from luvex import KNN  # Import your model

def test_knn():
    X_train = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]])
    y_train = np.array([0, 1, 0])
    X_test = np.array([[2, 2]])
    
    model = KNN(k=2)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)
    
    assert predictions >= [0]  # Test if the prediction is correct

if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_knn()
    print("All tests passed for KNN")

## Test MultiLinear Regression

import numpy as np
from luvex import MultipleLinear  # Import your model

def test_multiple_linear():
    X_train = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]])  # Example with two features
    y_train = np.array([1, 2, 3]).reshape(-1, 1)  # Ensure y_train is a 2D array (column vector)
    X_test = np.array([[2, 3]])  # Test sample

    model = MultipleLinear(learning_rate=0.01, iterations=1000)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict()

    #assert np.allclose(predictions, np.array([2]))  # Ensure predictions match expected value



if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_multiple_linear()
    print("All tests passed for MultipleLinear")

## testing Decision Tree

import numpy as np
from luvex.node import Node
from luvex.decisiontree import DecisionTree


def test_decision_tree():
    X_train = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]])
    y_train = np.array([0, 1, 0])
    X_test = np.array([[2, 2]])

    model = DecisionTree()
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    assert predictions[0] >= 1  # Fix the expected prediction here based on your model



if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_decision_tree()
    print("All tests passed for DecisionTree")

## Testing Random Forests

import numpy as np
from luvex import RandomForest  # Import your model
from luvex.decisiontree import DecisionTree
from luvex import RandomForest 

def test_random_forest():
    X_train = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]])
    y_train = np.array([0, 1, 0])
    X_test = np.array([[2, 2]])

    model = RandomForest(n_trees=3, max_depth=5, min_samples_split=2, n_features=1)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    predictions = model.predict(X_test)

    assert predictions[0] >= 0  # Modify to check the first value in the returned array


if __name__ == "__main__":
    test_random_forest()
    print("All tests passed for RandomForest")
