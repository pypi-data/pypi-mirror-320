class Body:
    """
    A class that represents a body in the simulation.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The body's name.
        mass (np.float64): The mass of the body in kilograms.
        position (np.ndarray): The initial position of the body (in vector form).
        velocity (np.ndarray): The initial velocity of the body (in vector form).
        radius (np.float64): The radius of the body in meters.
        color (str): The color of the body.
        light (bool): Whether the body should give off light.
        retain (int): How many points the body should retain on its trail.
        radius_multiplier (int): A multiplier to be applied to the radius.
