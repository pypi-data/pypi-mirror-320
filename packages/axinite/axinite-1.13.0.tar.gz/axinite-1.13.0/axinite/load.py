    Args:
        delta (u.Quantity): The change in time between each step.
        limit (u.Quantity): The limit of the simulation.
        backend (function): The backend to load the simulation from.
        t (u.Quantity, optional): The initial time. Defaults to 0 * u.s.
        modifier (function, optional): The modifier to apply to forces in the simulation. Defaults to None.
        action (function, optional): An action to call with frequency `action_frequency`. Defaults to None.
        action_frequency (int, optional): The frequency at which to call the `action`. Defaults to 200.
