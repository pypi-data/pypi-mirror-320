## USE-CASES

### Consideration
#### Use Case 1 : Experiment history tracking 
     As an user, I want to fine-tuning a model by some methods and changing hyper-parameter. I want to store all result of each experiment before making decision

#### Use case 2. Standardize dataset
    As an user, I want to access any dataset easliy and in a same way

#### Use Case 3 : Algorithms Recommendation/Suggestion/Category for specific problems
    User have a problem such as time series problem (predict cancer, price, ...,) which model now is good starting choice?

#### Use Case 4: Model optimization
    Quatization, pruning model, ...
    
#### Use Case 5: Multiple device support for infer
    Mobile, IoT device ...
