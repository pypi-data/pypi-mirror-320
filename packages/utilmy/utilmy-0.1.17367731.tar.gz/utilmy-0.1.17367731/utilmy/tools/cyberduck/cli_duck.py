    ##### Dataset  from google
    duck --list "googledrive:/My Drive/dataset/"  --username emial@gmail.com  


Connection Profiles
You can install additional connection profiles in the application support directory. Use the --profile option
 to reference a connection profile file to use not installed in the standard location.

Linux
The support directory is ~/.duck/ on Linux. You can install third party profiles in ~/.duck/profiles/.

Install additional profiles in %AppData%\Cyberduck\Profiles on Windows.

    Command Line Interface (CLI)
    Cyberduck with a command-line interface (CLI) is available for Mac, Windows & Linux. It is installed as duck.

    Installation
    macOSWindowsLinux
    Chocolatey

    Available as a Chocolatey package. Use

    choco install duck
    to install.

    MSI Installer

    Download the latest setup.

    Snapshot Builds

    Not currently available.

    CLI Setup
    Usage
    Usage:duck [options...]

    Run --help to get the option screen.

    URLs in arguments must be fully qualified. Paths can either denote a remote file ftps://user@example.net/resource or folder ftps://user@example.net/directory/ with a trailing slash. You can reference files relative to your home directory with /~ftps://user@example.net/~/.

    Connection Profiles
    You can install additional connection profiles in the application support directory. Use the --profile option to reference a connection profile file to use not installed in the standard location.

    URI
    The <url> argument for --copy, --download, --upload, and --synchronize must satisfy following rules:

    Each URL must start with a scheme and a colon (https:)(unless you specify a --profile)

    Depending on the type of protocol you are referencing different rules apply

    For all protocols where no default hostname is set (e.g. WebDAV, SFTP, and FTPS) you must use a fully qualified URI https://user@hostname/path

    For all protocols where a default hostname is set, but you are allowed to change it (e.g. S3) you may use fully qualified URIs or Absolute paths: s3:/bucket/path, Relative paths: s3:user@path or s3:user@/path. Omitting the first slash in a relative path uses the default home directory for this protocol.

    For all protocols where a default hostname is set and you are not allowed to change it (e.g. OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive) you may use any combination of the above with the following rules: Fully Qualified URIs are parsed as relative paths. onedrive://Some/Folder/ is parsed as onedrive:Some/Folder.

    For all protocols where a default path is set and you are not allowed to change it (e.g. accessing a prebuilt NextCloud profile with a path set to /remote.php/webdav). You are allowed to change the path but it will be appended to the default path. Making nextcloud:/path really nextcloud:/remote.php/webdav/path.

    Note

    Spaces and other special-characters are not required to be percent-encoded (e.g. %20 for space) as long as the path is quoted duck --upload "scheme://hostname/path with/spaces" "/Path/To/Local/File With/Spaces".

    duck --username <Access Key ID> --list s3:/<bucketname>/
    Generic Options
    --retry
    Retry requests with I/O failures once per default. Useful on connnection timeout or latency issues.

    --quiet
    Suppress progress messages.

    --throttle
    Throttle bandwidth to the number of bytes per second.

    Credentials
    You can pass username as part of the URI prepending to the hostname with username@host. Alternatively, use the --username option. You can give the password with the --password option or you will be prompted before the connection is opened by the program if no password matching the host is found in your login keychain (OS X) or user configuration shared with Cyberduck (Windows).

    Uploads with --upload
    Glob Pattern Support for Selecting Files to Transfer
    If your shell supports glob expansion you can use a wildcard pattern to select files for upload like

    duck --upload ftps://<hostname>/directory/ ~/*.jpg
    Use of ~
    You can use the tilde to abbreviate the remote path pointing to the remote home folder as in sftp://duck.sh/~/. It will be expanded when constructing absolute paths.

    Remote Directory Listing with --list
    Make sure to include a trailing ‘/’ in the path argument to denote a directory. Use the -L option to print permission mask and modification date in addition to the filename.

    Edit with --edit
    You can edit remote files with your preferred editor on your local system using the --edit command. Use the optional --application option to specify the absolute path to the external editor you want to use.

    Purge Files in CDN with --purge
    Purge files in CloudFront or Akamai CDN for Amazon S3 or Rackspace CloudFiles connections. For example to invalidate all contents in a bucket run

    Multiple Transfer Connections with --parallel
    Transfer files with multiple concurrent connections to a server.
