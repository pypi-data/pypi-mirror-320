        "text": "<p>The electric vehicle (EV) economy represents a future where battery electric vehicles (BEV) are readily used in transportation. Making up less than 2% of the total passenger vehicles in use, BEVs are presented with significant space for growth, while derived demand from EVs would also bode well for batteries and charging solutions. Falling battery costs and improvements in their range make BEVs competitive against gasoline counterparts. Aggressive electrification targets are also expected to drive the demand over the next few decades. If all proposed sustainability policies and electrification targets are met, the number of BEVs on the road is expected to hit around 196 million by 2030 (from around 20 million in 2022). </p>"
