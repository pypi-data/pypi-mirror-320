              Problem :
              - Given a text or [text] and a sumamry -> generate an evaluation score
              Solution :
              - compute two scores : Coverage (texts -> summary) and align (summary -> texts)
              - final score is min(coverage_score,align_score)

              Details:
              - coverage score?
              step 1 : given text or [texts] generate (n) questions that always answer -yes-
              step2 : given sumary as context generate answer for questions (yes/no/idk) - penalize only idk questions

              - align score? (measure hallu)
              step 1 : geerate claims from summary
              step 2 : give sumary and sumary as inputs and outiput a dict of verified summary claims (yes,no,idk) with reason

"Agora has launched its âfully collateralizedâ US digital dollar, AUSD, on the Avalanche network.

Built on the philosophy that money should be neutral, AUSD brings to âbear an open model that incentivizes businessesâfrom exchanges and applications to Fintechs and payment providersâto contribute to and service the network and, in turn, participate in the economics stemming from its growth and adoption.â

After having minted $40M within its first two weeks âon Ethereum Mainnet, the AUSD stablecoin has expanded to Avalanche with $20M+ minted and integrations with critical ecosystem infrastructure.â

Trader Joe provides a platform for âtrading AUSD with high efficiency and low slippage. Its Liquidity Book model concentrates liquidity, allowing for more efficient trades, which is particularly beneficial for larger transactions.â

This integration empowers global users âwith access to AUSD through DeFi, enhancing the tokenâs liquidity and market reach.â

Meanwhile, BENQI enhances the functionality âof AUSD by providing users with a robust platform for lending, borrowing, and staking, thereby expanding its reach and utility within the Avalanche DeFi ecosystem. Additional ecosystem projects contributing to Agora include Pharaoh Exchange, Dexalot, and Wombat Exchange.â

The stablecoin market has grown âto $165 billion at present, with 27.5 million monthly active users across all blockchain ecosystems.â

Notably, the market is projected to âreach $3 trillion by 2028 as consumer platforms integrate the technology and increase accessibility to a global user base.â

The United States Dollar remains the worldâs âprincipal reserve currency and the most widely used for international trade, accounting for a 58% share of foreign exchange reserves worldwide, 59% of SWIFT payments, and 88% of FX transaction volume.â

With stablecoins getting dollars into global hands âat faster rates, Agora wants to return revenue to those businesses driving its adoption at global scale.â

Avalancheâs EVM compatibility, âsub-second transaction finality, low transaction fees, and enhanced customizability allow the team to operate AUSD on proven infrastructure at scale.â

In addition, the networkâs top tier DeFi ecosystem, âcombined with its growing real world asset landscape and institutional participation, positions AUSD to capture attention from both crypto-native users and blockchain-enabled businesses alike.â

One such business is Avalanche-native protocol Trensi, which âenables Money Services Businesses to settle global cross-border payments more efficiently and cost-effectively.â

This capability is crucial for businesses âlooking to streamline international transactions. Trensi aims to leverage AUSD in its global funding and financing operations, further demonstrating real-world interoperability and applicability beyond the crypto-native space.â

âWeâre thrilled to see AUSD launch on Avalanche. Agoraâs focus on opening the door to billions of people who were previously excluded from the global economy and dollar financial ecosystem closely aligns the view that blockchains and tokenization have the power to upgrade legacy financial services infrastructure and, in turn, make what once was economically prohibitive fundamentally more accessible.â

For the time being, Agora serves markets âoutside the United States and does not serve US persons or entities. AUSD is freely tradeable, and retail holders do not receive income generated by Agora.â

However, the model maintains that businesses âdriving liquidity and utility are adequately compensated.â

These businesses can use cash flow âfrom Agora to improve their usersâ experience through lower fees, stronger products, and more.â

AUSD is fully backed by cash, US Treasury bills, and âovernight reverse repurchase agreements.â

"PARIS â In a rematch of their two previous encounters this summer in which the United States emerged victorious by scores of 61-57 and 70-65, Team USA once again edged out Spain, 66-56, in a closely contested Paralympic opener in Bercy Arena on Thursday afternoon.

âWeâre talking about the best of the best right now,â Team USAâs Trevon Jenifer said of the two teams. âThis is the biggest tournament we have so we know weâre going to get a teamâs best shot out here, so we had to come out and take care of business. Spain gave us some really good play for our first game.â

The game stayed close early as the two teams traded the first four baskets before Jake Williams knocked down back-to-back threes to put the Americans up 10-6 less than four minutes into the game.

After a second chance basket from Jennifer, Spain connected on a 3-pointer that cut the deficit to just one and nearly took the lead, but missed the layup to end the opening frame 18-17 in favor of the Americans.

Williams was everywhere on the court scoring eight points, and adding two rebounds and two assists in just the first quarter.

The second quarter picked up right where the first left off, with Jenifer scoring a quick two points before Spain took the points right back, grabbing its first lead with 5:25 left to play in the period. However, Bell immediately banked one off the glass to retake the lead at 24-23.

While that was Spainâs only lead, the United States was unable to pull away more than two possessions, fighting their way to a 32-29 advantage going into the break.

âSpain is an all-world team,â five time Paralympian and team captain Steve Serio said. âWe knew that Spain always brings it. They are not an opponent that you can overlook. We definitely have a lot of room to grow, but weâll go back and look at the game tape and get better.â

The third quarter saw Team USA begin to pull away when Serio's and-one play at the 7:36 mark gave them a 36-29 lead. Spain continued to fight back, but the Americans maintained a comfortable margin. Jennifer's fast break score with 3:01 remaining in the period extended the lead to eight.

Team USA took a 46-40 lead into the fourth quarter before Spain made a late push, cutting the lead to just one possession with just over six minutes remaining. However, the Americans held on, securing the victory with a final score of 66-56.

Jake Williams led the way with 22 points and seven assists, but said that this is just the start.

âEveryoneâs excited to get the first game going,â Williams said. âWe play Spain a lot at these tournaments so we know what to expect.â

The victory sets Team USA up well for the remainder of the group stage as they will play the Netherlands on Saturday at 10 a.m. ET."	"In a closely contested Paralympic opener at Bercy Arena, Team USA defeated Spain 66-56, marking their third victory over the team this summer.

Singapore's paper was presented by Justice Philip Jeyaretnam, with Justice A. Muhamed Mustaque offering a response from the Indian judiciary.

Chief Justice Menon said at the opening of the Roundtable, ""The annual Roundtable afforded us a valuable platform for discussions on topics of mutual interest, in particular, issues relating to AI and climate change. These are important and timely topics which represent some of the most critical challenges that impact all of humanity today, and which have already given rise to new and often complex legal issues that transcend jurisdictional boundaries. The event underscores the ongoing commitment of both Singapore and India to deepen our judicial cooperation and to strengthen the rule of law in an increasingly interconnected world. I look forward to many more of such collaborations between our two judiciaries and I extend my deepest appreciation to Chief Justice Chandrachud for graciously hosting this second roundtable.""

"The way jockey Tyler Gaffalione sees it, being successful at Kentucky Downs is all about momentum. If the 29-year-old is going to win his third consecutive riding title at the seven-day meet in Franklin, Ky., he has to have momentum on his side.

On Thursday, Gaffalione said it was all about momentum as Irish Aces won the $500,000 The Big Ass Fans Tapit Stakes, the opening day feature.

Irish Aces, trained by Brendan Walsh and owned by Marc Wampler and Jared Shoemakerâs Pocket Aces Racing, edged Nineeleventurbo by a head to get the victory in the one-mile and 70-yard race.

âHe is not an explosive horse,â Gaffalione said after the race. âHe kind of builds on momentum. You keep building him up and he keeps finding.â

Irish Aces began finding when Gaffalione began asking. Early on, the pair rated inside and then came up two deep of the outside of the 17-1 Nineeleventurbo, who was ridden by Florent Geroux.

Heading down the stretch, the two horses separated from the rest of the field and it was Irish Aces who found more and had the momentum edge at the wire.

âThis is a cool horse,â said Paul Madden, Walshâs assistant who saddled Irish Aces. âHeâs run some sneaky good races this year and itâs not the biggest surprise. Great race, picked out by the boss, and itâs been the plan for a while. And it came together.â

Walsh, who won the training title last year, had a solid opening day as he won two races. He won the third race with Oscar Season, who is also owned by Pocket Aces Racing. Walsh ran six horses on opening day; all of them hit the board.

Irish Aces, the 3-1 second choice in the field of nine, won for the third time in eight career starts on the grass. In his last start, a second level allowance at Saratoga on July 13, he finished third â beaten a half-length -- as the even-money favorite.

âHe was a little unlucky that day,â Gaffalione, who rode him that day, said. âHe got caught behind a wall coming into the stretch and I had to wait a long time before I was able to get him out. It was unfortunate, but he definitely made up for it today.â

The 4-year-old Irish Aces is a son of Mshawish. He was bred in Kentucky by Lynch Bages LTD.

The final time for the race was 1:41.71.

Nineeleventurbo, trained by Neil Drysdale, took the lead from the start and carved out fractions of :24.38, :48.39, 1:13.66 and 1:37.67. But the 7-year-old gelding could not hold off the determined charge from Irish Aces.

âHe gave me a great deal of confidence going around there,â Gaffalione said. âHe was traveling well throughout. When I called on him â it was a hard-fought duel â he kept finding and got the job done.â

Siege of Boston finished third and was followed by 4-5 favorite Chasing the Crown, Howling Time, Eamonn, last yearâs winner Harlan Estate, Miranda Rights and English Bee."	"Jockey Tyler Gaffalione emphasized the importance of momentum for success at Kentucky Downs, aiming for his third consecutive riding title. On the opening day, he rode Irish Aces to victory in the $500,000 The Big Ass Fans Tapit Stakes, narrowly defeating Nineeleventurbo. Irish Aces, trained by Brendan Walsh and owned by Pocket Aces Racing, showcased a steady build-up of momentum during the race. Gaffalione noted that Irish Aces is not explosive but finds strength as the race progresses. Walsh had a successful day, winning two races, including one with Oscar Season, also owned by Pocket Aces Racing. Irish Aces, a 4-year-old son of Mshawish, has now won three of his eight career starts on grass. The race concluded with a time of 1:41.71. Nineeleventurbo led early but could not withstand the challenge from Irish Aces. Siege of Boston finished third, followed by the favorite Chasing the Crown.

"New Delhi: In a big boost to widen the ambit of financial inclusion, the Finance Ministry has clarified that there is no restriction on LGBTQIA+ couples to open joint bank account. The finance ministry further said that queer people can also name their partners as the nominee.

An advisory issued by the Finance Ministry on August 28 had said, ""In connection with Honâble Supreme Court of Indiaâs judgement dated 17.10.2023 in the case of Supriyo @Supriya Chakraborty and another Vs. Union of India (Writ Petition Civil No. 1011/2022), this is to clarify that there are no restrictions for persons of the Queer community to open a joint bank account and also to nominate a person in queer relationship as a nominee to receive the balance in the account, in the event of death of the account holder.""

Rights Of Transgender Persons-Changes in Bank Forms/Applications: Check What RBI 2015 Circular Had Said

""It has been brought to our notice that transgender persons face difficulties in opening accounts as there is no provision for them in the account opening and other forms. In this connection, banks are advised to refer to the judgement dated April 15, 2014 of the Supreme Court in the case of National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India and others [AIR 2014 SC 1863: (2014) 5 SCC 438] on treating all transgender persons as âthird genderâ. The Supreme Court, in that case, upheld transgender personsâ right to decide their self-identified gender and directed the Centre and State Government to grant legal recognition of their gender identity such as male, female or as third gender.

Banks are, therefore, directed to include âthird genderâ in all forms/applications etc. prescribed by the Reserve Bank or the banks themselves, wherein any gender classification is envisaged, RBI had said.

Availment Of Nomination Facility: RBI Had Said This In April 2009

The Reserve Bank of India had issued a circular on April 2009, under Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules, 1985 â Acknowledgement of Nomination and indicating the Name of the Nominee in Pass Books / Fixed Deposit Receipts.

RBI had mentioned, When a bank account holder has availed himself / herself of nomination facility, the same may be indicated on the passbook so that, in case of death of the account holder, the relatives can know from the pass book that the nomination facility has been availed of by the deceased depositor and take suitable action. Banks may, accordingly, introduce the practice of recording on the face of the passbook the position regarding availment of nomination facility with the legend ""Nomination Registered"". This may be done in the case of term deposit receipts also.

In addition, the RBI had advised banks to indicate the name of the Nominee in the Pass Books / Statement of Accounts / FDRs, in case the customer is agreeable to the same, as this would be helpful to the customers/ nominees."	"The Finance Ministry of India has clarified that LGBTQIA+ couples can open joint bank accounts and name their partners as nominees, following a Supreme Court ruling. This advisory aims to enhance financial inclusion for the queer community. The ministry referenced a Supreme Court judgment from October 17, 2023, which supports the rights of queer individuals in banking. Additionally, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has previously addressed the challenges faced by transgender persons in opening bank accounts, directing banks to include 'third gender' options in their forms. The RBI also emphasized the importance of nomination facilities in banking, ensuring that account holders can designate nominees for their accounts. This move is part of ongoing efforts to recognize and support the rights of marginalized communities in the financial sector.

"Chelsea have reportedly informed Victor Osimhen that they are willing to move forward on a late move that could cost well over Â£60million if the striker is happy to concede on his wage demands. The Athletic claim that Osimhen has held extensive talks with the Blues, but the club are awaiting the green light from the 25-year-old over whether he will agree to fit in with their incentive-based salary structure. Under the Todd Boehly hierarchy, Chelsea have attempted to slash the amount of money spent on wages by as much as 50 per cent despite their bloated squad, but it remains to be seen whether Osimhen is willing to follow suit.

Earlier this week, Osimhen's agent wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter): ""Osimhen is a Napoli player, with a contract recently renewed with mutual satisfaction. He made history and when there were major offers (also this year) we always accepted the club's decisions. ""As I said, it is not a package to be shipped far away to make room for new prophets. Victor was elected African footballer of the year, eighth at the Ballon d'Or, he still has so much to do in Europe. There is need respect and balance."" Chelsea have until 11pm on Friday to get a deal done.

It has proven to be a very busy deadline day for Chelsea, who are attempting to move on their 'bomb squad' currently training away from Maresca's first-team group. That includes Raheem Sterling and Ben Chilwell, who have been the subject of talks with rivals Manchester United, with the prospect of Jadon Sancho heading in the opposite direction."	"Chelsea is reportedly interested in signing striker Victor Osimhen, with a potential deal exceeding Â£60 million contingent on his acceptance of a reduced wage structure. The club has been working to cut wage expenses by up to 50% under the Todd Boehly administration. Osimhen has engaged in extensive discussions with Chelsea, but the final decision rests with him regarding the salary terms. His agent emphasized that Osimhen remains committed to Napoli, where he recently renewed his contract, and highlighted his achievements, including being named African Footballer of the Year. Chelsea has until 11 PM on Friday to finalize any deal. The club is also busy on deadline day, looking to offload players from their 'bomb squad,' including Raheem Sterling and Ben Chilwell, who are in talks with Manchester United.

This collaboration will equip researchers and educators with the resources needed to push the boundaries of knowledge and positively impact their communities.â

#         From online courses and virtual classrooms to shared research projects and streamlined administration, cloud platforms have the potential to revolutionise learning experiences and usher in a new era of educational accessibility and innovation across the continent.

#         âHigh-speed internet connectivity is crucial to unlocking the full potential of cloud technology for education and research in Africa. We can significantly reduce network infrastructure costs by adopting a collaborative approach, pooling resources, and negotiating collectively. These savings are directly passed on to our NRENs, ultimately benefiting African universities and academic institutions. The Redington and AWS partnership will be instrumental in helping us leverage the advantages of cloud technology effectively,â Ogot added.

#         The partnership will also grant NRENs access to Redingtonâs extensive expertise and technical support. Redington will guide cloud procurement, implementation, and ongoing management, ensuring a smooth transition to AWS cloud services for UbuntuNet Alliance members.

#         "Agora has launched its âfully collateralizedâ US digital dollar, AUSD, on the Avalanche network.

#         Built on the philosophy that money should be neutral, AUSD brings to âbear an open model that incentivizes businessesâfrom exchanges and applications to Fintechs and payment providersâto contribute to and service the network and, in turn, participate in the economics stemming from its growth and adoption.â

#         After having minted $40M within its first two weeks âon Ethereum Mainnet, the AUSD stablecoin has expanded to Avalanche with $20M+ minted and integrations with critical ecosystem infrastructure.â

#         Trader Joe provides a platform for âtrading AUSD with high efficiency and low slippage. Its Liquidity Book model concentrates liquidity, allowing for more efficient trades, which is particularly beneficial for larger transactions.â

#         This integration empowers global users âwith access to AUSD through DeFi, enhancing the tokenâs liquidity and market reach.â

#         Meanwhile, BENQI enhances the functionality âof AUSD by providing users with a robust platform for lending, borrowing, and staking, thereby expanding its reach and utility within the Avalanche DeFi ecosystem. Additional ecosystem projects contributing to Agora include Pharaoh Exchange, Dexalot, and Wombat Exchange.â

#         The stablecoin market has grown âto $165 billion at present, with 27.5 million monthly active users across all blockchain ecosystems.â

#         Notably, the market is projected to âreach $3 trillion by 2028 as consumer platforms integrate the technology and increase accessibility to a global user base.â

#         The United States Dollar remains the worldâs âprincipal reserve currency and the most widely used for international trade, accounting for a 58% share of foreign exchange reserves worldwide, 59% of SWIFT payments, and 88% of FX transaction volume.â

#         With stablecoins getting dollars into global hands âat faster rates, Agora wants to return revenue to those businesses driving its adoption at global scale.â

#         Avalancheâs EVM compatibility, âsub-second transaction finality, low transaction fees, and enhanced customizability allow the team to operate AUSD on proven infrastructure at scale.â

#         In addition, the networkâs top tier DeFi ecosystem, âcombined with its growing real world asset landscape and institutional participation, positions AUSD to capture attention from both crypto-native users and blockchain-enabled businesses alike.â

#         One such business is Avalanche-native protocol Trensi, which âenables Money Services Businesses to settle global cross-border payments more efficiently and cost-effectively.â

#         This capability is crucial for businesses âlooking to streamline international transactions. Trensi aims to leverage AUSD in its global funding and financing operations, further demonstrating real-world interoperability and applicability beyond the crypto-native space.â

#         âWeâre thrilled to see AUSD launch on Avalanche. Agoraâs focus on opening the door to billions of people who were previously excluded from the global economy and dollar financial ecosystem closely aligns the view that blockchains and tokenization have the power to upgrade legacy financial services infrastructure and, in turn, make what once was economically prohibitive fundamentally more accessible.â

#         For the time being, Agora serves markets âoutside the United States and does not serve US persons or entities. AUSD is freely tradeable, and retail holders do not receive income generated by Agora.â

#         However, the model maintains that businesses âdriving liquidity and utility are adequately compensated.â

#         These businesses can use cash flow âfrom Agora to improve their usersâ experience through lower fees, stronger products, and more.â

#         AUSD is fully backed by cash, US Treasury bills, and âovernight reverse repurchase agreements.â

#         Notably, its reserves are fully managed âby the $100 billion asset management firm, VanEck, and custodied at State Street.â"	"Agora has launched its fully collateralized US digital dollar, AUSD, on the Avalanche network, promoting a neutral monetary philosophy. Within two weeks, AUSD minted $40M on Ethereum and over $20M on Avalanche, integrating with key ecosystem infrastructure. Trader Joe facilitates efficient trading of AUSD, while BENQI enhances its utility through lending, borrowing, and staking. The stablecoin market is currently valued at $165 billion and is projected to reach $3 trillion by 2028. AUSD aims to return revenue to businesses driving its adoption globally. The Avalanche network offers EVM compatibility, low fees, and fast transaction finality, making it suitable for AUSD. Trensi, an Avalanche-native protocol, plans to use AUSD for efficient cross-border payments. Agora currently serves markets outside the US and does not cater to US persons or entities. AUSD is fully backed by cash and US Treasury bills, with reserves managed by VanEck and custodied at State Street.

#         "PARIS â In a rematch of their two previous encounters this summer in which the United States emerged victorious by scores of 61-57 and 70-65, Team USA once again edged out Spain, 66-56, in a closely contested Paralympic opener in Bercy Arena on Thursday afternoon.

#         âWeâre talking about the best of the best right now,â Team USAâs Trevon Jenifer said of the two teams. âThis is the biggest tournament we have so we know weâre going to get a teamâs best shot out here, so we had to come out and take care of business. Spain gave us some really good play for our first game.â

#         The game stayed close early as the two teams traded the first four baskets before Jake Williams knocked down back-to-back threes to put the Americans up 10-6 less than four minutes into the game.

#         After a second chance basket from Jennifer, Spain connected on a 3-pointer that cut the deficit to just one and nearly took the lead, but missed the layup to end the opening frame 18-17 in favor of the Americans.

#         Williams was everywhere on the court scoring eight points, and adding two rebounds and two assists in just the first quarter.

#         2024 Paris Olympics: Follow USA TODAYâs coverage of the biggest names and stories of the Games.

#         The second quarter picked up right where the first left off, with Jenifer scoring a quick two points before Spain took the points right back, grabbing its first lead with 5:25 left to play in the period. However, Bell immediately banked one off the glass to retake the lead at 24-23.

#         While that was Spainâs only lead, the United States was unable to pull away more than two possessions, fighting their way to a 32-29 advantage going into the break.

#         âSpain is an all-world team,â five time Paralympian and team captain Steve Serio said. âWe knew that Spain always brings it. They are not an opponent that you can overlook. We definitely have a lot of room to grow, but weâll go back and look at the game tape and get better.â

#         The third quarter saw Team USA begin to pull away when Serio's and-one play at the 7:36 mark gave them a 36-29 lead. Spain continued to fight back, but the Americans maintained a comfortable margin. Jennifer's fast break score with 3:01 remaining in the period extended the lead to eight.

#         Team USA took a 46-40 lead into the fourth quarter before Spain made a late push, cutting the lead to just one possession with just over six minutes remaining. However, the Americans held on, securing the victory with a final score of 66-56.

#         Jake Williams led the way with 22 points and seven assists, but said that this is just the start.

#         âEveryoneâs excited to get the first game going,â Williams said. âWe play Spain a lot at these tournaments so we know what to expect.â

#         The victory sets Team USA up well for the remainder of the group stage as they will play the Netherlands on Saturday at 10 a.m. ET."	"In a closely contested Paralympic opener at Bercy Arena, Team USA defeated Spain 66-56, marking their third victory over the team this summer.

#         The Honourable the Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon led the delegation from the Supreme Court of Singapore to New Delhi, India.

Singapore's response was articulated by Justice See Kee Oon.

#         The second topic of the Roundtable was led by the Singapore judiciary which covered the attribution of legal responsibility for harms caused by AI and the legal status of AI-generated material. Singapore's paper was presented by Justice Philip Jeyaretnam, with Justice A. Muhamed Mustaque offering a response from the Indian judiciary.

#         Chief Justice Menon said at the opening of the Roundtable, ""The annual Roundtable afforded us a valuable platform for discussions on topics of mutual interest, in particular, issues relating to AI and climate change. These are important and timely topics which represent some of the most critical challenges that impact all of humanity today, and which have already given rise to new and often complex legal issues that transcend jurisdictional boundaries. The event underscores the ongoing commitment of both Singapore and India to deepen our judicial cooperation and to strengthen the rule of law in an increasingly interconnected world. I look forward to many more of such collaborations between our two judiciaries and I extend my deepest appreciation to Chief Justice Chandrachud for graciously hosting this second roundtable.""

#         "The way jockey Tyler Gaffalione sees it, being successful at Kentucky Downs is all about momentum. If the 29-year-old is going to win his third consecutive riding title at the seven-day meet in Franklin, Ky., he has to have momentum on his side.

#         On Thursday, Gaffalione said it was all about momentum as Irish Aces won the $500,000 The Big Ass Fans Tapit Stakes, the opening day feature.

#         Irish Aces, trained by Brendan Walsh and owned by Marc Wampler and Jared Shoemakerâs Pocket Aces Racing, edged Nineeleventurbo by a head to get the victory in the one-mile and 70-yard race.

#         âHe is not an explosive horse,â Gaffalione said after the race. âHe kind of builds on momentum. You keep building him up and he keeps finding.â

#         Irish Aces began finding when Gaffalione began asking. Early on, the pair rated inside and then came up two deep of the outside of the 17-1 Nineeleventurbo, who was ridden by Florent Geroux.

#         Heading down the stretch, the two horses separated from the rest of the field and it was Irish Aces who found more and had the momentum edge at the wire.

#         âThis is a cool horse,â said Paul Madden, Walshâs assistant who saddled Irish Aces. âHeâs run some sneaky good races this year and itâs not the biggest surprise. Great race, picked out by the boss, and itâs been the plan for a while. And it came together.â

#         Walsh, who won the training title last year, had a solid opening day as he won two races. He won the third race with Oscar Season, who is also owned by Pocket Aces Racing. Walsh ran six horses on opening day; all of them hit the board.

#         Irish Aces, the 3-1 second choice in the field of nine, won for the third time in eight career starts on the grass. In his last start, a second level allowance at Saratoga on July 13, he finished third â beaten a half-length -- as the even-money favorite.

#         âHe was a little unlucky that day,â Gaffalione, who rode him that day, said. âHe got caught behind a wall coming into the stretch and I had to wait a long time before I was able to get him out. It was unfortunate, but he definitely made up for it today.â

#         The 4-year-old Irish Aces is a son of Mshawish. He was bred in Kentucky by Lynch Bages LTD.

#         The final time for the race was 1:41.71.

#         Nineeleventurbo, trained by Neil Drysdale, took the lead from the start and carved out fractions of :24.38, :48.39, 1:13.66 and 1:37.67. But the 7-year-old gelding could not hold off the determined charge from Irish Aces.

#         âHe gave me a great deal of confidence going around there,â Gaffalione said. âHe was traveling well throughout. When I called on him â it was a hard-fought duel â he kept finding and got the job done.â

#         Siege of Boston finished third and was followed by 4-5 favorite Chasing the Crown, Howling Time, Eamonn, last yearâs winner Harlan Estate, Miranda Rights and English Bee."	"Jockey Tyler Gaffalione emphasized the importance of momentum for success at Kentucky Downs, aiming for his third consecutive riding title. On the opening day, he rode Irish Aces to victory in the $500,000 The Big Ass Fans Tapit Stakes, narrowly defeating Nineeleventurbo. Irish Aces, trained by Brendan Walsh and owned by Pocket Aces Racing, showcased a steady build-up of momentum during the race. Gaffalione noted that Irish Aces is not explosive but finds strength as the race progresses. Walsh had a successful day, winning two races, including one with Oscar Season, also owned by Pocket Aces Racing. Irish Aces, a 4-year-old son of Mshawish, has now won three of his eight career starts on grass. The race concluded with a time of 1:41.71. Nineeleventurbo led early but could not withstand the challenge from Irish Aces. Siege of Boston finished third, followed by the favorite Chasing the Crown.

#         "New Delhi: In a big boost to widen the ambit of financial inclusion, the Finance Ministry has clarified that there is no restriction on LGBTQIA+ couples to open joint bank account. The finance ministry further said that queer people can also name their partners as the nominee.

#         An advisory issued by the Finance Ministry on August 28 had said, ""In connection with Honâble Supreme Court of Indiaâs judgement dated 17.10.2023 in the case of Supriyo @Supriya Chakraborty and another Vs. Union of India (Writ Petition Civil No. 1011/2022), this is to clarify that there are no restrictions for persons of the Queer community to open a joint bank account and also to nominate a person in queer relationship as a nominee to receive the balance in the account, in the event of death of the account holder.""

#         Rights Of Transgender Persons-Changes in Bank Forms/Applications: Check What RBI 2015 Circular Had Said

#         ""It has been brought to our notice that transgender persons face difficulties in opening accounts as there is no provision for them in the account opening and other forms. In this connection, banks are advised to refer to the judgement dated April 15, 2014 of the Supreme Court in the case of National Legal Services Authority v. Union of India and others [AIR 2014 SC 1863: (2014) 5 SCC 438] on treating all transgender persons as âthird genderâ. The Supreme Court, in that case, upheld transgender personsâ right to decide their self-identified gender and directed the Centre and State Government to grant legal recognition of their gender identity such as male, female or as third gender.

#         Banks are, therefore, directed to include âthird genderâ in all forms/applications etc. prescribed by the Reserve Bank or the banks themselves, wherein any gender classification is envisaged, RBI had said.

#         Availment Of Nomination Facility: RBI Had Said This In April 2009

#         The Reserve Bank of India had issued a circular on April 2009, under Banking Companies (Nomination) Rules, 1985 â Acknowledgement of Nomination and indicating the Name of the Nominee in Pass Books / Fixed Deposit Receipts.

#         RBI had mentioned, When a bank account holder has availed himself / herself of nomination facility, the same may be indicated on the passbook so that, in case of death of the account holder, the relatives can know from the pass book that the nomination facility has been availed of by the deceased depositor and take suitable action. Banks may, accordingly, introduce the practice of recording on the face of the passbook the position regarding availment of nomination facility with the legend ""Nomination Registered"". This may be done in the case of term deposit receipts also.

#         In addition, the RBI had advised banks to indicate the name of the Nominee in the Pass Books / Statement of Accounts / FDRs, in case the customer is agreeable to the same, as this would be helpful to the customers/ nominees."	"The Finance Ministry of India has clarified that LGBTQIA+ couples can open joint bank accounts and name their partners as nominees, following a Supreme Court ruling. This advisory aims to enhance financial inclusion for the queer community. The ministry referenced a Supreme Court judgment from October 17, 2023, which supports the rights of queer individuals in banking. Additionally, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has previously addressed the challenges faced by transgender persons in opening bank accounts, directing banks to include 'third gender' options in their forms. The RBI also emphasized the importance of nomination facilities in banking, ensuring that account holders can designate nominees for their accounts. This move is part of ongoing efforts to recognize and support the rights of marginalized communities in the financial sector.

#         "Chelsea have reportedly informed Victor Osimhen that they are willing to move forward on a late move that could cost well over Â£60million if the striker is happy to concede on his wage demands.
