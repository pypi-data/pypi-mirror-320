###Instruction: You are a knowledge graph builder. Now please fuse two sub-knowledge graphs about the concept "{concept}".
Graph 1:
{graph1}

Graph 2:
{graph2}

Rules for Fusing the Graphs:
1. Union the concepts and edges.
2. If two concepts are similar, or they are referring to the same concept, combine them as one concept by keeping the meaningful or specific one. For example, "lstm" versus "long short-term memory",  please keep "long short-term memory".
3. We only allow one relation to exist between two concepts, if there is a conflict,  read the following "##background" to help you keep the correct one. knowledge to keep the correct one.  For example, (ROUGE, Evaluate-for, question answering model) and (ROUGE,Used-for , question answering model) are considered to be conflicts.
4. Once step 3 is done, consider every possible concept pair, which did not occur in step 2. For example, take a concept in G1, and match a concept from G2. And look at the "##background" ,  and summarize new triplets.

Hint: the relation types and their definition. You can use it to do Step 3:
    {relation_definitions}



##Background: {background}

###Output Instruction: Output the new merged data by listing the triplets.	Your answer should ONLY contain triplets in this format: (concept, relation, concept). No other explanations or numbering are needed. Only triplets, no intermediate results.
