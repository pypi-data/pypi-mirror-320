It includes the culled cows and bulls sold annually. The operation implements a 20% replacement rate; therefore, the calf output represents 80% of the calves born minus mortality. The other 20% are kept to replace the culled cows and bulls that have reached the end of their reproductive lifespan. This process includes flows for material inputs and environmental emissions associated with feed including mother cows and bulls. Animals are grazed on grass pasture except occasional supplemental feed in winter months or in times of drought. Emissions and resource use were simulated using the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM). The IFSM simulation was constructed to represent the Roman L. Hruska U.S. Meat Animal Research Center (MARC) in Nebraska in 2011.","version":"00.00.027","lastChange":"2018-07-31T10:11:09.006-04:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"a249bb2d-a7c4-301d-97a1-aa8842903581","name":"ISIC 0141: Raising of cattle and buffaloes","categoryPath":["Agriculture, forestry, and fishing"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"PHYSICAL_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":true,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"669eb22e-cf87-3b59-a553-06880eed6a5a","name":"United States, Nebraska"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"Operations were modeled using IFSM and intended to be representative of conditions in 2011.","technologyDescription":"Calves were weaned at 6 mo of age weighing about 296 kg. Of these calves, 1,180 were raised as replacements to meet a 20% replacement rate for the cows and bulls. Cows were maintained on rotationally grazed pasture using supplemental forage produced by the farming operation and small amounts of purchased feed to meet energy and mineral requirements","dataCollectionDescription":"Data for this project were collected from 2015 through 2017.  ","completenessDescription":"Fate and transport of active ingredients in pesticides and heavy metals from fertilizers are not included. Impacts associated with the manufacture or maintenance of capital goods, chemotherapeutics, or cleaning agents were not considered. Impacts from upstream production of input flows like fertilizers and electricity require a connection to DataSmart.","dataSelectionDescription":"Data were selected from the MARC farm because, as a research facility, detailed records were kept and made available for comparison to simulated values. The operational records were used to construct a simulation of the operation in IFSM. 25 years of simulations were run in IFSM with annual weather records and the average values from the 25 simulations proivded the LCI values.","reviewDetails":"LCA Commons Staff conducts a critical review of data set organization and documentation. ","dataTreatmentDescription":"\"The beef production system of MARC was modeled as 4 components: crop farm, spring-calving cow– calf operation, fall-calving cow–calf operation, and feedlot. Production and economic information for 2011 was used to set parameters in IFSM for each of the 4 components. The accuracy of the simulated system was evaluated by comparing predicted feed production and use, energy use, and production costs to actual records of MARC for 2011.\" From Rotz et al. 2013","inventoryMethodDescription":"This process is intended to be used with the finishing process and therefore no allocation is made between the calves and culls. Animals culled within the year are included in the total annual live weight produced from the operation.","modelingConstantsDescription":"About 5,498 cows and 285 bulls were maintained throughout 2011 to produce 5,050 calves. Mature maternal cow weight was 636 kg, and mature bull weight was 908 kg. Calves were weaned at 6 mo of age weighing about 296 kg. Of these calves, 1,180 were raised as replacements to meet a 20% replacement rate for the cows and bulls. ","samplingDescription":"This unit process is part of a product system for beef cattle production that was created using information from Rotz et al. 2013 among other sources. It is not the model used in that study; however, the authors from that study graciously provided assisstance in formatting their efforts into the OpenLCA platform.","restrictionsDescription":"These LCA Commons data (“Data”) are provided by the National Agricultural Library (“NAL”), part of the Agricultural Research Service (“ARS”), U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”).
