Includes arable land, emissions, and energy use like diesel and gasoline for on farm equipment.","dataCollectionDescription":"Data for this project were collected from 2015 through 2017. ","completenessDescription":"Fate and transport of active ingredients in pesticides and heavy metals from fertilizers are not included. Impacts associated with the manufacture or maintenance of capital goods, chemotherapeutics, or cleaning agents were not considered. Impacts from upstream production of input flows like fertilizers and electricity require a connection to DataSmart.","dataSelectionDescription":"Data were selected from the MARC farm because, as a research facility, detailed records were kept and made available for comparison to simulated values. The operational records were used to construct a simulation of the operation in IFSM. 25 years of simulations were run in IFSM with annual weather records and the average values from the 25 simulations proivded the LCI values.","reviewDetails":"LCA Commons Staff conducts a critical review of data set organization and documentation. ","dataTreatmentDescription":"\"The beef production system of MARC was modeled as 4 components: crop farm, spring-calving cow– calf operation, fall-calving cow–calf operation, and feedlot. Production and economic information for 2011 was used to set parameters in IFSM for each of the 4 components. The accuracy of the simulated system was evaluated by comparing predicted feed production and use, energy use, and production costs to actual records of MARC for 2011.\" From Rotz et al. 2013","inventoryMethodDescription":"This process includes all of the pasture related emissions and resource requirements on the MARC farm in 2011. It is intended to be used in conjunction with the MARC farm beef cattle product system.","modelingConstantsDescription":"The dry matter output of 23042 tons represents the grass from the pasture consumed from the cow-calf portion of the MARC farm in one year.","samplingDescription":"This unit process is part of a product system for beef cattle production that was created using information from Rotz et al. 2013 among other sources. It is not the model used in that study; however, the authors from that study graciously provided assisstance in formatting their efforts into the OpenLCA platform.","restrictionsDescription":"These LCA Commons data (“Data”) are provided by the National Agricultural Library (“NAL”), part of the Agricultural Research Service (“ARS”), U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”).
