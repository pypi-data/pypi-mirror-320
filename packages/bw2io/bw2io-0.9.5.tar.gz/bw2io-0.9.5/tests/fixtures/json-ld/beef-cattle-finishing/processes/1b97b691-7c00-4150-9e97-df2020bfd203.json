The live weight produced includes the finisher cattle plus the cull cows and bulls marketed in a year. All feeds were produced on farm with the exception of some supplements and crude protein, which were purchased. Emissions and resource use were simulated using the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM). The IFSM simulation was constructed to represent the Roman L. Hruska U.S. Meat Animal Research Center (MARC) in Nebraska in 2011.","version":"00.00.042","lastChange":"2018-07-31T10:11:05.784-04:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"a249bb2d-a7c4-301d-97a1-aa8842903581","name":"ISIC 0141: Raising of cattle and buffaloes","categoryPath":["Agriculture, forestry, and fishing"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"PHYSICAL_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":false,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"669eb22e-cf87-3b59-a553-06880eed6a5a","name":"United States, Nebraska"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"Operations were modeled using IFSM and intended to be representative of conditions in 2011.","technologyDescription":"This process represents the finishing portion of the MARC farm, which begins once calves are weaned and includes a 3 month backgrounding period followed by a 7 month finishing period. During backgrounding, cattle were fed primarily hay and silage and consumed mostly corn and distillers grain during finishing. Finished cattle were 16 months old and weighed 581 kg.","dataCollectionDescription":"Data for this project were collected from 2015 through 2017.  ","completenessDescription":"Fate and transport of active ingredients in pesticides and heavy metals from fertilizers are not included. Impacts associated with the manufacture or maintenance of capital goods, chemotherapeutics, or cleaning agents were not considered. Impacts from upstream production of input flows like fertilizers and electricity require a connection to DataSmart.","dataSelectionDescription":"Data were selected from the MARC farm because, as a research facility, detailed records were kept and made available for comparison to simulated values. The operational records were used to construct a simulation of the operation in IFSM. 25 years of simulations were run in IFSM with annual weather records and the average values from the 25 simulations proivded the LCI values.","reviewDetails":"LCA Commons Staff conducts a critical review of data set organization and documentation. ","dataTreatmentDescription":"\"The beef production system of MARC was modeled as 4 components: crop farm, spring-calving cow– calf operation, fall-calving cow–calf operation, and feedlot. Production and economic information for 2011 was used to set parameters in IFSM for each of the 4 components. The accuracy of the simulated system was evaluated by comparing predicted feed production and use, energy use, and production costs to actual records of MARC for 2011.\" From Rotz et al. 2013","inventoryMethodDescription":"In order to avoid allocation, the total live weight produced from this process includes finished cattle and cull cows and bulls produced during one year. Feeds produced on the MARC farm were consumed by the various type of animals raised on site; however, MARC farm records from 2011 indicate that 82.5% of the feeds produced on site were used in beef cattle operations. Therefore, 82.5% of impacts from crop production at the MARC farm are attributed to cattle production, which includes feed consumed in the cow-calf and finishing portions of the operation.","modelingConstantsDescription":"Total live weight produced includes the following animals, which were marketed during a year of operation:\r\nFinished cattle: 3724 (581 kg/finisher)\r\nCulled cows: 1156 (636 kg/cow)\r\nCulled bulls: 58 (908 kg/cow)","samplingDescription":"This unit process is part of a product system for beef cattle production that was created using information from Rotz et al. 2013 among other sources. It is not the model used in that study; however, the authors from that study graciously provided assisstance in formatting their efforts into the OpenLCA platform.","restrictionsDescription":"These LCA Commons data (“Data”) are provided by the National Agricultural Library (“NAL”), part of the Agricultural Research Service (“ARS”), U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”).
