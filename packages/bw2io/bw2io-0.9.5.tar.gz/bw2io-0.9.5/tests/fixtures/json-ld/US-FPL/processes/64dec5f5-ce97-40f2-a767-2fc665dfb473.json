The two co-products are a synthesis gas (syngas) and biochar. As of August 2016, the Tucker RNG process is currently operational as a pilot scale project in Charlotte, North Carolina. A duplicate Tucker RNG process is set to take place in St. Regis, Montana along with a chip operation sawmill. \r\nAdditional details on the process can be found in Gu and Bergman (2016).","version":"01.00.012","lastChange":"2019-11-25T14:54:18.145-05:00","category":{"@type":"Category","@id":"0927a450-e2b2-3455-983b-42ff1ebacc3c","name":"3251: Basic Chemical Manufacturing","categoryPath":["31-33: Manufacturing"],"categoryType":"Process"},"processType":"UNIT_PROCESS","defaultAllocationMethod":"CAUSAL_ALLOCATION","infrastructureProcess":true,"location":{"@type":"Location","@id":"a220b227-87c9-368d-8bfe-5ff357517419","name":"United States, Montana"},"processDocumentation":{"@type":"ProcessDocumentation","timeDescription":"Tucker RNG process input and emissions data were collected as primary data in 2016. Secondary data were collected from a variety of sources and over a range of years (2013-2016).","technologyDescription":"The Tucker RNG process uses high-temperature (\u003e750°C) thermochemical conversion in a low oxygen environment to convert feedstock from forest thinning and mill residues into biochar and syngas (see Tables 1 and 2 of Gu and Bergman (2016)).  The biochar can be used as a soil amendment or as a precursor in the manufacturing of activated carbon and other industrial carbon products. The syngas can be used for heat and electricity generation.\r\n\r\nThe system minimizes the introduction of atmosphere using a double air lock coupled with a feedstock compression system that expels interpaticulate air from the feedstock before heating.   For more details on feedstock properties, see Table 1 of Gu and Bergman (2016).  This being an endothermic proces, three propane burners are fired to provide heat to the active chamber. The feedstock is then transferred to an active section in which the temperature reaches 870°C. The generated biochar and syngas are transferred to a passive section without any external heat source. Syngas leaving the passive section is cooled in a tar condenser. After cooling, syngas passes through a misting chamber that removes oil and tars before leaving the Tucker RNG unit thus leaving the two primary products: biochar and medium energy syngas.  For more details on biochar and syngas properties, see Tables 1  and 2 of Gu and Bergman (2016). \r\n\r\nThe emissions from the Tucker RNG specific conversion were not measured at the testing point and, therefore, not accounted for. Only operational data, such as feedstock input, utility use and heat source were measured or calculated to model the process.  A more complete description of the Tucker RNG process can be found in Gu and Bergman (2016).","dataCollectionDescription":"Tucker RNG process input data were collected as primary data from 2013 to 2016.","completenessDescription":"The environmental emissions from the Tucker RNG specific conversion were not measured at the testing point and therefore not accounted for. There is a small amount of water discharged from the Tucker RNG unit which was meaured and accounted for as the waste flow, \"water; from thermochemical conversion; at plant\".  The process, \"Whole-Tree-Chips\",  was modeled by the authors with primary data collected on the chipping process in a Montana sawmill.","dataSelectionDescription":"Primary data was collected for all flows with two exceptions: \r\n1) Electricity, at eGrid, NWPP, 2008\r\n2) Liquefied petroleum gas, combusted in industrial boiler\r\n\r\nData for these two exceptions were taken from the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory Database (National Renewable Energy Laboratory 2016).  Gu and Bergman\u0027s cradle-to-gate LCA also used secondary data from the US-EI SimaPro® Library (EARTHSHIFT 2016).","dataTreatmentDescription":"The following inputs were measured during the operation of the Tucker RNG process:\r\n1) Electricity\r\n2) Whole tree chips\r\n3) Propane gas\r\n\r\nTo model the Tucker RNG heating source, propane gas (density \u003d 0.1175 lb/ft^3) was measured at a volumetric flow rate of 638 ft^3/hr (mass flow rate \u003d 74.965 lb/hr) and then converted to liters.  This volume of gas was then applied to the U.S. Life Cycle Inventory (USLCI) database (National Renewable Energy Laboratory 2016) flow  \"Liquefied petroleum gas, combusted in industrial boiler\" as reflected in the Inputs/Outputs tab.  The density of the Liquified petroleum gas flow was calculated to be 0.58 kg/L based on information provided in USLCI database. \r\n\r\nHuman labor and the manufacture of machinery and infrastructure fell outside of the system boundaries and were not considered in this unit process.","samplingDescription":"This unit process reflects the gate-to-gate inputs, outputs, waste flows, and emissions for the Tucker RNG  process.
