The process is assumed to represent production in US Inland Northwest (INW), eastern Washington, eastern Oregon, Idaho and western Montana. Data survey was conducted at a wood mill that converting forestry land softwood into wood chips using Tricon Timber and Tucker Engineering Associate (TEA) system in Missoula, MT in 2013. \r\nThe feedstock log resources are consist of 74% from national forests in that area, 8% from MT DNRL, 6% from IDL, and 12% from private party. The wood logs are chipped and screened to micro wood chips (\u003c1.3 cm in the largest dimension) using BM\u0026M chip screens, and dried to 6% using hog fuel in sawdust dryer. \r\nFeedstock transportation, chipping and screening application, drying with hog fuels. 100% chip production and no allocation applied. Emission to air and water are minor and not included, and other data were collected according to CORRIM guidelines from peer-reviewed literature and in Gu and Bergman (2016).
