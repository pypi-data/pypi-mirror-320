Jupyblog allow you to write blog posts from Jupyter.

We use it at [Ploomber](https://github.com/ploomber/ploomber) to write [technical blog posts](https://ploomber.io/blog/snapshot-testing/) and publish them in our [Hugo](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) blog; however, any engine that takes markdown files works.
