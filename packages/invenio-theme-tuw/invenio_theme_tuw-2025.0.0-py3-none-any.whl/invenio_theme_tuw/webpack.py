# our override for the frontend build project:
# we override the build configuration (based on the one provided in `invenio-assets`)
# in order to customize its behaviour, e.g. allowing the collection of '*.webp' images.
#
# implementation note, in case you'll need to touch this:
# `project.path` is overridden by the `_PathStorageMixin` in `flask_webpackext` and
# will point to the directory specified by `app.config['WEBPACKEXT_PROJECT_BUILDDIR']`,
# which # will be used as the working directory for `npm`, and also specifies where
# the assets from each module should be copied to.
#
# rough explanation of the arguments:
# * import_name:    the import name of the current module, will be used to determine
#                   the base path where to look for the provided assets/configs
# * project_folder: the sub-directory in which to look for the `package.json`
# * config_path:    where to put npm's `config.json` (inside the `project_folder`)
# * bundles:        the bundles that should be used for building the frontend

# * import_name: similar to above
