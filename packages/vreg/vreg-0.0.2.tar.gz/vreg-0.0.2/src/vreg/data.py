    Notes:

        The following datasets are currently available:

        **iBEAt**

            **Background**: data are provided by the imaging work package of the 
            `BEAt-DKD project <https://www.beat-dkd.eu>`_ .

            **Data format**: The fetch function returns a list of dictionaries, 
            one per subject visit. Each dictionary contains the following items:

            - **item1**: description.
            - **item2**: description.

            Please reference the following paper when using these data:

            Gooding et al.
