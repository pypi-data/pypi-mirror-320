DEPRECATED
==========

This package is deprecated and no longer maintained, since it is no longer
compatible with `yet_another_wizz` version 3. Starting from version 3, a
simplified commandline client is directly integrated and this external
dependency is no longer required.

Commandline tool
================

*yet_another_wizz_cli* implements a command line interface for the clustering
redshift code `yet_another_wizz <https://github.com/jlvdb/yet_another_wizz>`_:

- code: https://github.com/jlvdb/yet_another_wizz_cli.git
- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/yet_another_wizz_cli/
- Docker: https://hub.docker.com/r/jlvdb/yet_another_wizz_cli/

The documentation of this commandline tool is part of the official documentation
of *yet_another_wizz* itself, including some usage examples:

- docs: https://yet-another-wizz.readthedocs.io/

Refer especially to the sections **User guide / Usage examples** and
**User guide / Command line tools**.

.. Note::
    When using this code in published work, please cite
    *van den Busch et al. (2020), A&A 642, A200*
    (`arXiv:2007.01846 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01846>`_)


Installation
------------

The *yet_another_wizz* package can be installed directly with pip::

    pip install yet_another_wizz_cli

This will install the python package ``yaw`` as dependency, as well as the
``yaw_cli`` executable command line tool that is shipped with this package.


Usage
-----

After installation, the command line tool can be invoked by typing ``yaw_cli```
on the terminal. The tool is organised into a number subcommands that each
serve a specific purpose. To obtain an overview over the available options,
type::

    $ yaw_cli --help

Each subcommand operates on a single output directly, which organises all
intermediate and output data products for easy access, as well as logging and
a summary of the operations performed in a single YAML configuration file.

The most important subcommand is ``yaw_cli run``, which computes clustering
redshifts from such a YAML configuration file. A template for the configuration
file can be printed to the terminal using::

    $ yaw_cli run --dump

For more details refer to the to *User guide / Command line tools* section in
the documentation of *yet_another_wizz*.
