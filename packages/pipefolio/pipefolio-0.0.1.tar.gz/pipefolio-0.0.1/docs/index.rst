**Pipefolio** is a Python-based portfolio optimization framework designed with a pipeline-oriented approach. While several excellent Python libraries for portfolio optimization already exist—such as `PyPortfolioOpt <https://github.com/robertmartin8/PyPortfolioOpt>`_, `Riskfolio-Lib <https://github.com/dcajasn/Riskfolio-Lib>`_, and `skfolio <https://github.com/skfolio/skfolio>`_—Pipefolio takes a different direction.

Built on top of `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_, Pipefolio leverages existing optimization algorithms while minimizing boilerplate code through the use of the **pipe (|) operator**, enabling a streamlined and efficient workflow.

The framework provides the following types of models, each serving a specific purpose in the portfolio optimization process:
