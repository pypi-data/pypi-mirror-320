- update stdp script once we have decided on the network
- change all examples to OrderedDict (see stdp example) and same structure
- add comment of mushroombody script at top (e.g. reference their paper)
- update format of compartmental examples to fit the single compartment examples python scripts
    (attention: multiple run statements might not allow profiling even for last run call?)
