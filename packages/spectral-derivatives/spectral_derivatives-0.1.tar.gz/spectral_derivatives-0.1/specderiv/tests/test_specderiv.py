# To be run by CI with `coverage` and `pytest`, with results uploaded to coveralls and badge displayed in the readme

# A test that the MSE of derivatives up to some high power is suitably low

# A test of the endpoints code

# A test of the middle polynomial-finding code (maybe need to split out?)

# A test for even derivatives vs odd derivatives

# A test for multidimensional derivatives

# A test for non-periodic derivatives vs periodic and equispaced
