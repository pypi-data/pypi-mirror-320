### 2. Analyze your chat

```python
from whatsapp_reality import preprocess, analyzer

# Read and preprocess your chat file
with open('chat.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
    chat_data = file.read()
    
# Create the DataFrame
df = preprocess(chat_data)

# Now you can use any of the analysis functions!

# Get basic stats
messages, words, media, links = analyzer.fetch_stats('Overall', df)
print(f"Total Messages: {messages}")
print(f"Total Words: {words}")
print(f"Media Messages: {media}")
print(f"Links Shared: {links}")

# Analyze user activity
fig, df_percent = analyzer.most_busy_users(df)
fig.show()  # Shows the interactive plotly visualization

# Generate word cloud
wordcloud = analyzer.create_wordcloud('Overall', df)

# Analyze sentiment
sentiments, most_positive, most_negative = analyzer.calculate_sentiment_percentage('Overall', df)
print(f"Most positive user: {most_positive}")
print(f"Most negative user: {most_negative}")

# Analyze reply patterns
user, time, msg, reply = analyzer.analyze_reply_patterns(df)
print(f"User with longest reply time: {user}")
print(f"Reply took {time:.2f} minutes")
```
