# CD-SEM
This is a package for analysing SEM images to extract PSD informaiton for use in other
data analysis pipelines.

The current beta Version 0.1 is as close to a direct port over from the Mathematica
notebook written by Ricardo Ruiz. Analysis methods have not yet been imported.

This project is funded by the CHiPPS EFRC at Berkeley National Laboratory.

## Use
Use the 'RunThis_CD_SEM_Analysis.ipynb' file to run the analysis of your SEM (*.tif) image.
