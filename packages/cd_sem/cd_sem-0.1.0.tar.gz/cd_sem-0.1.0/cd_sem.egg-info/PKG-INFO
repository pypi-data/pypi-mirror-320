# CD-SEM
Line Roughness Calculation for DSA images. Version 1.0 is as close to a direct port over from Mathematica as possible. Version 2.0(beta) is a complete rework of program functions to include some enhanced Python functionality and improve computation times.

This project is funded by the CHiPPS EFRC at Berkeley National Laboratory.

The goal is to port Mathematica code originally written by Ricardo Ruiz into an open-source Python platform
