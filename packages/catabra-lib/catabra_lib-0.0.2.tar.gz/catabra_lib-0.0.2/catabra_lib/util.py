    """Convert a given array-like into a scalar or Numpy array, unless it is one already. Ensure that it has a given
    rank and data type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like
        The array-like to convert. Currently supported are scalars (float, int, bool), Numpy arrays, pandas Series and
        DataFrames, and all other objects that implement a `to_numpy()` method or that can be converted using
        `numpy.asarray()`.
    arg_name : str, optional
        Name of `x`, as it is displayed in exceptions and warnings.
    rank : tuple of int, default=(0, 1)
        Allowed ranks (i.e., number of dimensions) of `x`. 0 corresponds to scalars, 1 to vectors, 2 to matrices.
    dtype : str, optional
        Allowed data types of `x`, string of single-character data type kinds like "i", "f", "b". If None, no data type
        check happens. Note that `x` is not cast to the specified type; instead, an exception is raised if it does not
        have a suitable type.

    Returns
    -------
    scalar | ndarray
        Scalar or Numpy array corresponding to `x`. Could be `x` itself, or one of its class members.
