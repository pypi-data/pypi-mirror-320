# LLFO - Lifelong Learning in Flexible Ontologies

A Python package implementing lifelong learning algorithms with flexible ontological structures.

## Theory

LLFO combines lifelong learning with flexible ontological structures to enable continuous knowledge acquisition and adaptation. Key concepts include:

### Flexible Ontologies
- Dynamic knowledge representation through adaptable concept hierarchies
- Automatic restructuring of relationships between concepts
- Probabilistic edge weights between ontological nodes

### Lifelong Learning Components
- Knowledge retention through experience replay
- Forward transfer to new tasks
- Backward transfer to improve previous knowledge
- Catastrophic forgetting prevention

### Learning Mechanisms
- Ontology structure learning
- Parameter learning within nodes
- Relationship weight adaptation
- Task-specific adaptation

## Installation

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```python
import llfo

# Example code coming soon
```
