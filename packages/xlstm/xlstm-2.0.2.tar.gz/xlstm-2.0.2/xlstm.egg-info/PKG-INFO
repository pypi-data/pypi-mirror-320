              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

# xLSTM: Extended Long Short-Term Memory

![xLSTM Figure](./res/desc_xlstm_overview.svg)

> Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04517

## About

xLSTM is a new Recurrent Neural Network architecture based on ideas of the original LSTM.
Through Exponential Gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques and a new Matrix Memory it overcomes the limitations of the original LSTM 
and shows promising performance on Language Modeling when compared to Transformers or State Space Models.

# xLSTM Large 7B

:rotating_light: We trained a 7B parameter xLSTM Language Model :rotating_light:

![xLSTM Figure](./res/xlstm_7b_poster.svg)

We have optimized the xLSTM architecture in terms of training throughput and stability. 
The code for the updated architecture is located in `xlstm/xlstm_large`.

The model weights are available on Huggingface at https://huggingface.co/NX-AI/xLSTM-7b. 

## Minimal Installation

Create a conda environment from the file `environment_pt220cu121.yaml`.
Install the model code only (i.e. the module `xlstm`) as package:

Install via pip: 
```bash
pip install xlstm
```
Clone from github:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NX-AI/xlstm.git
cd xlstm
pip install -e .
```

For using the 7B xLSTM model install `mlstm_kernels` via:
``` 
pip install mlstm_kernels
```

## Requirements

This package is based on PyTorch and was tested for versions `>=1.8`. For the CUDA version of sLSTM, you need Compute Capability >= 8.0, see [https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus). For a well-tested environment, install the `environment_pt220cu121.yaml` as:
```bash
conda env create -n xlstm -f environment_pt220cu121.yaml
conda activate xlstm
``` 

For the xLSTM Large 7B model we require our `mlstm_kernels` (TODO add github link) package, which provides fast kernels for the xLSTM.


# Models from the xLSTM Paper

This section explains how to use the models from the xLSTM paper.

## Usage

For non language applications or for integrating in other architectures you can use the `xLSTMBlockStack` and for language modeling or other token-based applications you can use the `xLSTMLMModel`.

### xLSTM Block Stack

The `xLSTMBLockStack` is meant for use as alternative backbone in existing projects. It is similar to a stack of Transformer blocks, but uses xLSTM blocks:

```python
import torch

from xlstm import (
    xLSTMBlockStack,
    xLSTMBlockStackConfig,
    mLSTMBlockConfig,
    mLSTMLayerConfig,
    sLSTMBlockConfig,
    sLSTMLayerConfig,
    FeedForwardConfig,
)

cfg = xLSTMBlockStackConfig(
    mlstm_block=mLSTMBlockConfig(
        mlstm=mLSTMLayerConfig(
            conv1d_kernel_size=4, qkv_proj_blocksize=4, num_heads=4
        )
    ),
    slstm_block=sLSTMBlockConfig(
        slstm=sLSTMLayerConfig(
            backend="cuda",
            num_heads=4,
            conv1d_kernel_size=4,
            bias_init="powerlaw_blockdependent",
        ),
        feedforward=FeedForwardConfig(proj_factor=1.3, act_fn="gelu"),
    ),
    context_length=256,
    num_blocks=7,
    embedding_dim=128,
    slstm_at=[1],

)

xlstm_stack = xLSTMBlockStack(cfg)

x = torch.randn(4, 256, 128).to("cuda")
xlstm_stack = xlstm_stack.to("cuda")
y = xlstm_stack(x)
y.shape == x.shape
```

If you are working with yaml strings / files for configuration you can also use dacite to create the config dataclasses. This is the same as the snippet above:

```python
from omegaconf import OmegaConf
from dacite import from_dict
from dacite import Config as DaciteConfig
from xlstm import xLSTMBlockStack, xLSTMBlockStackConfig

xlstm_cfg = """ 
mlstm_block:
  mlstm:
    conv1d_kernel_size: 4
    qkv_proj_blocksize: 4
    num_heads: 4
slstm_block:
  slstm:
    backend: cuda
    num_heads: 4
    conv1d_kernel_size: 4
    bias_init: powerlaw_blockdependent
  feedforward:
    proj_factor: 1.3
    act_fn: gelu
context_length: 256
num_blocks: 7
embedding_dim: 128
slstm_at: [1]
"""
cfg = OmegaConf.create(xlstm_cfg)
cfg = from_dict(data_class=xLSTMBlockStackConfig, data=OmegaConf.to_container(cfg), config=DaciteConfig(strict=True))
xlstm_stack = xLSTMBlockStack(cfg)

x = torch.randn(4, 256, 128).to("cuda")
xlstm_stack = xlstm_stack.to("cuda")
y = xlstm_stack(x)
y.shape == x.shape

```


### xLSTM Language Model

The `xLSTMLMModel` is a wrapper around the `xLSTMBlockStack` that adds the token embedding and lm head.

```python
from omegaconf import OmegaConf
from dacite import from_dict
from dacite import Config as DaciteConfig
from xlstm import xLSTMLMModel, xLSTMLMModelConfig

xlstm_cfg = """ 
vocab_size: 50304
mlstm_block:
  mlstm:
    conv1d_kernel_size: 4
    qkv_proj_blocksize: 4
    num_heads: 4
slstm_block:
  slstm:
    backend: cuda
    num_heads: 4
    conv1d_kernel_size: 4
    bias_init: powerlaw_blockdependent
  feedforward:
    proj_factor: 1.3
    act_fn: gelu
context_length: 256
num_blocks: 7
embedding_dim: 128
slstm_at: [1]
"""
cfg = OmegaConf.create(xlstm_cfg)
cfg = from_dict(data_class=xLSTMLMModelConfig, data=OmegaConf.to_container(cfg), config=DaciteConfig(strict=True))
xlstm_stack = xLSTMLMModel(cfg)

x = torch.randint(0, 50304, size=(4, 256)).to("cuda")
xlstm_stack = xlstm_stack.to("cuda")
y = xlstm_stack(x)
y.shape[1:] == (256, 50304)
```


## Experiments

The synthetic experiments show-casing the benefits of sLSTM over mLSTM and vice versa best are the Parity task and the Multi-Query Associative Recall task. The Parity task can only be solved with state-tracking capabilities provided by the memory-mixing of sLSTM. The Multi-Query Associative Recall task measures memorization capabilities, where the matrix-memory and state expansion of mLSTM is very beneficial.
In combination they do well on both tasks.

To run each, run the `main.py` in the experiments folder like:
```
python experiments/main.py --config experiments/parity_xLSTM01.yaml   # xLSTM[0:1], sLSTM only
python experiments/main.py --config experiments/parity_xLSTM10.yaml   # xLSTM[1:0], mLSTM only
python experiments/main.py --config experiments/parity_xLSTM11.yaml   # xLSTM[1:1], mLSTM and sLSTM
```

Note that the training loop does not contain early stopping or test evaluation.
