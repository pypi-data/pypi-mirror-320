NeuroCarto: A Neuropixels Channelmap Editor
===========================================

[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/neurocarto)](https://pypi.org/project/neurocarto/)
![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/neurocarto)

NeuroCarto is a neural probe channel map editor for the Neuropixels probe family.
It allows user to create a blueprint for arranging electrodes in a desired density
and generate a custom channel map.

Features
--------

- Read/Visualize/Modify/Write Neuropixels channelmap files (`*.imro`).
- Read SpikeGLX meta file (`*.meta`).
- Read/Visualize/Modify/Write Blueprint (a blueprint for generating a channelmap by a programming way).
- Show Atlas mouse brain as a background image.
- Customize electrode selection and probe kind.
- Show channel efficiency and electrode density.
