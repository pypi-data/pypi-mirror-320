Question:
'how to find files in a directory that were modified in the last 24 hours?' - user is on macOS-15.1.1-arm64-arm-64bit

Answer:
On MacOS, use the find command with -mtime to filter files based on modification time. For example
```shell
find /path/to/directory -type f -mtime -1
```
This will search for all files (`-type f`) and run `sed` on each file to replace `old_string` with `new_string` (`-i` for in-place editing).

Question
'how to identify which processes are using the most CPU resources?' - user is on

Answer:
Use `top` or `ps` to display the processes sorted by CPU usage. For example:
```bash
top -o %CPU
```
or
```bash
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -n 10
```
The top command will show an interactive process list sorted by CPU usage, and the ps command shows the top 10 processes consuming the most CPU resources.

Question
'how to list all active ports and their status?'

Answer:
Use `netstat` with the `-tuln` options. For example
```bash
netstat -tuln
```
 - `-t` shows TCP connections,
 - `-u` shows UDP connections,
 - `-l` shows only listening ports,
 - `-n` shows numerical addresses (instead of resolving hostnames).

This will display all active network connections and the listening ports.

Answer:
Use `curl` with the `-u` option for authentication and specify the FTP URL:
```bash
curl -u username:password -O ftp://ftp.example.com/path/to/file
```
- `-u` username:password provides the authentication credentials.
- `-O` saves the file with the same name as the remote file. This command downloads a file from an FTP server using the given credentials.
