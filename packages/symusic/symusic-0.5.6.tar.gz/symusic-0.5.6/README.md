**Sy**music("**Sy**bolic **Music**") is a cross-platform `note level` midi decoding library with lightening speed, which is hundreds of times faster (100x to 1000x depending on your file size) than [mido](https://github.com/mido/mido), the main midi parsing library in python.

The library is written in cpp and based on [minimidi](https://github.com/lzqlzzq/minimidi/tree/main). It offers a python binding using pybind11.

Here, we have added a tutorial.ipynb for you to learn about how to use the library. <a target="_blank" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/Yikai-Liao/symusic/blob/main/tutorial.ipynb">

And a [document](https://yikai-liao.github.io/symusic/) is also available. Not complete though.

## Features

* You can just read a midi file like `score = symusic.Score("path to midi", ttype="tick")`
* Writing back to midi is now supported! `score.dump_midi("path")`
* Multiple `time unit (ttype)` is now supported (currently `tick` and `quarter`)
* The tempo attribute in the tempo event represents quarter per minute (qpm)
* We offer some batch operation functions for both `Score` and `Track` class:
  * shift_pitch(offset: int)
  * shift_velocity(offset: int)
  * shift_time(offset: float)
  * sort(key, reverse)
* You can operate each note just like you did before in python (like PrettyMidi)
* Extremely fast `pickle` is now supported
* `.numpy()` method for getting [SoA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA) data
* `.filter(func, inplace)` method for filtering objets in all the "List" in symusic
* A new synthesizer is now available! It comes from our another project [prestosynth](https://github.com/lzqlzzq/prestosynth).
  Find usages in our document. Note that we will support more features of soundfont for synthesizing in the future.

## Installation
### Use pre-compiled version
```bash
pip install symusic
```

### Build from source
> Make sure that your system has cmake and c++ compilers
>
You could clone from github and install it by pip
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/Yikai-Liao/symusic
pip install ./symusic
```

Or you could install the source distribution from pypi
```bash
pip install symusic --no-binary symusic
```

For debugging purpose, you could pass `-Ccmake.define.MEM_LEAK_WARNING=True` to `pip install` to enable the memory leak warning from `nanobind`.
```bash
pip install -Ccmake.define.MEM_LEAK_WARNING=True ./symusic
```

## Benchmark

* `midifile` is writen in cpp, and could parse midi files to both `event level` and `note level`. It is slow mostly because of `iostream`.
* `mido` is writen in pure python, and only parses midi files to `event level`
* `pretty_midi` and `miditoolkit` is based on `mido`, and parse midi files to `note level`
* For libraries written in python or with python bindings, we use `timeit` to measure the time cost of parsing the midi file. `nanobench` for cpp libraries and `BenchmarkTools` for julia libraries.
* The following `Common MIDI File` benchmarks could be found in [symusic-benchmark](https://github.com/Yikai-Liao/symusic-benchmark). And they are tested on (AMD Ryzen 7 8845H, 32GB 7500 MT/s, Linux 6.11.7)

### Large MIDI File Parsing
* test using [mahler.mid](https://github.com/lzqlzzq/minimidi/blob/main/example/mahler.mid) from minimidi/example on my laptop (i7-10875H, 32GB 2666MHz DDR4 RAM, Linux 6.1.69-1-lts)
* Note that mahler.mid is quite a large midi file. So this benchmark mainly reelects the `parsing time` (the percentage of time of loading file gets more significant when file is smaller)
