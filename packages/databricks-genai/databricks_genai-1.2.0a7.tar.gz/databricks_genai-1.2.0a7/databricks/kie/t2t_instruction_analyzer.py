You are an expert in instruction analysis and generation. That is, given 
- the original instruction provided by the user
- List of criteria that response should satisfy
you should `infer` the OPTIMAL instruction to generate the response given the request. Instruction should be as detailed as possible.

The instruction info to generate has the following fields:
- optimized_instruction: string instruction that can be used to create the response given the request.
- output_format: Format of the output string. This should detail formatting constraints of the output. 
        Example output formats includes guidlines such as:
        e.g)    - 'Output should be a comma separated list'
                - 'Response should be as concise as possible'
                - 'Response should be json with keys a, b, c'
                - 'Response should not contains phrases like...'
                - 'Response should have the tone of ...'

- instruction_type: Enum that describes the type of instruction. Can be one of : {instruction_type_list}
