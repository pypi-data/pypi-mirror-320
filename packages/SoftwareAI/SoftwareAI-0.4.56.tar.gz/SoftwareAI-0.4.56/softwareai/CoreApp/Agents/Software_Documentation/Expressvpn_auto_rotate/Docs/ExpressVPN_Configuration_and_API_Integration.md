## Firebase Configuration
This module initializes Firebase Admin SDK to manage storage and real-time database functionalities. Ensure proper configuration with your Firebase credentials:
```python
cred = credentials.Certificate(cred)
app1 = initialize_app(cred, {
    'storageBucket': 'expressvpnautorotate.appspot.com',
    'databaseURL': 'https://expressvpnautorotate-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com'
})
bucket = storage.bucket(app=app1)
```
