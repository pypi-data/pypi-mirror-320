# Module: ExpressVPN Update Trigger

## Overview
This module triggers the execution of an update script for the ExpressVPN application using a subprocess call. 

## Usage Example
To execute the update procedure, the following code can be used:
```python
import subprocess
subprocess.run(["Dependenc/Python/python", "Dependenc/att_att.py"])
```

## Description
- The `subprocess.run` function is utilized to run the update script located at `Dependenc/att_att.py` using the Python interpreter located in the `Dependenc/Python` directory.
- This approach allows for executing scripts in a separate process, making it useful for running updates or other maintenance tasks without blocking the main application.

## Error Handling
The current implementation does not include error handling or validation of the subprocess call. It is recommended to check the return code of the subprocess for successful execution or handle any potential exceptions.

## Conclusion
This module serves as a simple interface for executing the update script for ExpressVPN. It relies on the `subprocess` module to manage the execution within a separate process, ensuring the application remains responsive during updates.
