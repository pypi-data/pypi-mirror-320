# Module: ExpressVPN Management and Update

## Overview
This module is responsible for managing and updating ExpressVPN by using Firebase for cloud storage and real-time database functionalities. It automates the process of checking for new versions of scripts and configurations, downloading them, and managing dependencies.

## Installation
Make sure to install the required packages if not already present:
```bash
pip install firebase-admin pyarmor psutil
```

## Firebase Configuration
This module initializes the Firebase Admin SDK with service account credentials. Make sure to configure it properly:
```python
cred = credentials.Certificate(cred)
app1 = initialize_app(cred, {
    'storageBucket': 'expressvpnautorotate.appspot.com',
    'databaseURL': 'https://expressvpnautorotate-default-rtdb.firebaseio.com'
})
bucket = storage.bucket(app=app1)
```

## Usage Example
### Begin Update and Upload Process
```python
# Initialize the update process
fazendo_o_download_da_nova_versao(bucket)
```

### Generate and Upload Scripts
The module generates the latest versions of scripts and configurations, zips them, and uploads them to Firebase:
```python
start_time = time.time()
lista = ['main.py']
for list in lista:
    subprocess.run(["pyarmor-8", "gen", "--assert-import", "--assert-call", "--enable-themida", "--enable-jit", "--mix-str", "--obf-code", "2", f"{list}"])
```

### Functions
#### `fazendo_o_download_da_nova_versao(bucket)`
Downloads and manages the new version files from Firebase.

**Parameters:**  
- `bucket`: Firebase storage bucket instance.

### `buscar_arquivo(nome_arquivo)`
Searches for a file in Firebase storage. If found, returns the blob; otherwise, notifies the user.

**Parameters:**  
- `nome_arquivo`: Name of the file to search in the Firebase bucket.

### Error Handling
This module includes error handling to manage failures during downloads or file manipulations, providing feedback for missing files or issues during zipping.

## Conclusion
This module provides an efficient way to manage and update the ExpressVPN application using Firebase. By automating version checks and uploads, it ensures that the application remains updated and operational without manual intervention.
