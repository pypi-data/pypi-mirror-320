# Changelog

## v1.1.0 (2025-01-11)

- Added `Account.running_balance` that iterates through each transaction in an
  account for the given date range, and includes the current running balance of

## v1.0.0 (2024-12-27)

- Accept any value that can be passed to the constructor of `stockholm.Money`
  wherever a `Money` object was required as an argument.

  a `Money`-convertible value as an `amount` parameter.
