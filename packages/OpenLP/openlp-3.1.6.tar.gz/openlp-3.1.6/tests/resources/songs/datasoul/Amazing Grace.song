    <Text>Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now im found,
Was blind, but now I see.
===
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
and grace my fears released.
How precious did that grace appear,
the hour I first believed.
===
When we've been there ten thousand years,
bright shining as the sun,
we've no less days to sing god's praise
than when did when we first begun.
===
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost, but now im found,
Was blind, but now I see.</Text>
