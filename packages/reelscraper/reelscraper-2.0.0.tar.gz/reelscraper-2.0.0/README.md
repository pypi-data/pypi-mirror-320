## 💻 Installation

Reel Scraper requires **Python 3.9+**. Install it from PyPI:

```bash
pip install reelscraper
```

Or clone from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andreaaazo/reelscraper.git
cd reelscraper
python -m pip install .
```

## 🚀 Usage

Below are two common ways to run the scraper—interactively in Python or via a CLI entry point (if provided).

### 1. Single Account or Single-Session Scraping
Use the `ReelScraper` class for scraping a single Instagram account’s Reels.

```python
from reelscraper import ReelScraper

# Initialize with desired settings
scraper = ReelScraper(timeout=30, proxy=None)

# Fetch up to 10 reels for username "someaccount"
reels_data = scraper.get_user_reels("someaccount", max_posts=10)
for reel in reels_data:
    print(reel)
```

### 2. Multiple Accounts with Concurrency
Use the `ReelMultiScraper` class to scrape Reels from multiple Instagram accounts in parallel.

```python
from reelscraper import ReelScraper
from reelscraper import ReelMultiScraper

# Initialize a single scraper instance
single_scraper = ReelScraper(timeout=30, proxy=None)

# Initialize the multi-scraper with a text file of usernames, one per line
multi_scraper = ReelMultiScraper(
    accounts_file="accounts.txt",
    scraper=single_scraper,
    max_workers=5  # concurrency level
)

# This returns a dict mapping each username to its list of reels
all_reels = multi_scraper.scrape_accounts()
print(all_reels)
```

**File-based approach**: Provide a file named `accounts.txt` with one username per line:
```
user1
user2
user3
```
The code will automatically read these usernames and scrape their Reels in parallel.

## 🏗 Classes

### `ReelScraper`
- Wraps around `InstagramAPI` and `Extractor` to fetch Reels data.  
- **Methods**:
  - `get_user_reels(username, max_posts, max_retries)`: Gathers Reels for a given username, with optional pagination and retries.

### `ReelMultiScraper`
- Manages scraping multiple accounts in parallel using `ReelScraper` (or a subclass) under the hood.  
- **Methods**:
  - `scrape_accounts()`: Dispatches concurrent requests to scrape each account listed in `accounts.txt` (or your chosen file).
