SBArchOpt (es-bee-ARK-opt) provides a set of classes and interfaces for applying Surrogate-Based Optimization (SBO)
for system architecture optimization problems:
- Expensive black-box problems: evaluating one candidate architecture might be computationally expensive
- Mixed-discrete design variables: categorical architectural decisions mixed with continuous sizing variables
- Hierarchical design variables: decisions can deactivate/activate (parts of) downstream decisions
- Multi-objective: stemming from conflicting stakeholder needs
- Subject to hidden constraints: simulation tools might not converge for all design points

Surrogate-Based Optimization (SBO) aims to accelerate convergence by fitting a surrogate model
(e.g. regression, gaussian process, neural net) to the inputs (design variables) and outputs (objectives/constraints)
to try to predict where interesting infill points lie. Potentially, SBO needs about one or two orders of magnitude less
function evaluations than Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEA's) like NSGA2. However, dealing with the
specific challenges of architecture optimization, especially in a combination of the challenges, is not trivial.
This library hopes to support in doing this.

The library provides:
- A common interface for defining architecture optimization problems based on [pymoo](https://pymoo.org/)
- Support in using Surrogate-Based Optimization (SBO) algorithms:
  - Implementation of a basic SBO algorithm
  - Connectors to various external SBO libraries
- Analytical and realistic test problems that exhibit one or more of the architecture optimization challenges

## Installation

First, create a conda environment (skip if you already have one):
```
conda create --name opt python=3.11
conda activate opt
```

Then install the package:
```
conda install "numpy<2.0"
pip install sb-arch-opt
```

Note: there are optional dependencies for the connected optimization frameworks and test problems.
Refer to their documentation for dedicated installation instructions.
