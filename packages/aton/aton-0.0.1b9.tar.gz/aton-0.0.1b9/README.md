# Welcome to Aton

The **A**b-ini**T**i**O** & **N**eutron research toolbox,
or [Aton](https://pablogila.github.io/Aton/),
provides powerful and comprehensive tools
for cutting-edge materials research,
focused on (but not limited to) neutron science.

Just like its [ancient Egyptian deity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aten) counterpart,
this all-in-one Python package contains a range of tools from spectra normalisation to deuteration estimations.
A set of physico-chemical constants and definitions is also included.
Aton also allows you to easily create, edit and analyse all kinds of text files,
with a special focus on *ab-initio* calculation files.
In particular, it contains interfaces for [Quantum ESPRESSO](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/),
[Phonopy](https://phonopy.github.io/phonopy/) and [CASTEP](https://castep-docs.github.io/castep-docs/).  

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pablogila/Aton/).   
Check the [full documentation online](https://pablogila.github.io/Aton/).

# Installation

As always, it is recommended to install your packages in a virtual environment:  
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```


## With pip

The fastest way to install Aton is through pip:  
```bash
pip install aton
```


## From source

Optionally, you can install Aton from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/pablogila/Aton/).  

First install the dependencies:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib
```

Then clone the repository or download the [latest stable release](https://github.com/pablogila/Aton/tags) as a ZIP, unzip it, and run inside the `Aton/` directory:  
```bash
pip install .
```

# Documentation

The full Aton documentation is available [online](https://pablogila.github.io/Aton/).  
An offline version of the documentation is found at `docs/aton.html`.  
Code examples are included in the `examples/` folder.    


## Interfaces for ab-initio codes

The **interface** module contains interfaces for several *ab-initio* codes.
These are powered by the [text](https://pablogila.github.io/Aton/aton/text.html) module and can be easily extended.

### [aton.interface](https://pablogila.github.io/Aton/aton/interface.html)

## Physico-chemical constants

The **phys** module contains physico-chemical definitions.
All values can be accessed directly as `phys.value` or `phys.function()`.

## Spectral analysis tools

The **spectra** module includes tools to analyse spectral data,
such as Inelastic Neutron Scattering, Raman, Infrared, etc.  

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** The spectra module is not yet 100% ported, bugs are expected!

# Contributing

If you are interested in opening an issue or a pull request, please feel free to do so on [GitHub](https://github.com/pablogila/Aton/).  
For major changes, please get in touch first to discuss the details.  


## Code style

Please try to follow some general guidelines:  
- Use a code style consistent with the rest of the project.  
- Include docstrings to document new additions.  
- Include automated tests for new features or modifications, see [automated testing](#automated-testing).  
- Arrange function arguments by order of relevance. Most implemented functions follow something similar to `function(file, key/s, value/s, optional)`.  


## Automated testing

If you are modifying the source code, you should run the automated tests of the `tests/` folder to check that everything works as intended.
To do so, first install PyTest in your environment,
```bash
pip install pytest
```

And then run PyTest inside the `Aton/` directory,
```bash
pytest -vv
```


## Compiling the documentation

The documentation can be compiled automatically to `docs/aton.html` with [Pdoc](https://pdoc.dev/) and Aton itself, by running:
```shell
python3 makedocs.py
```

This runs Pdoc, updating links and pictures, and using the custom theme CSS template from the `css/` folder.
