# Desk Organizer

A Python script that organize your Desktop

    pip install deskorganizer

    from deskorganizer import organizefiles

# Quick start

Python script that iterates alphabetically through the files in the 'Desktop' folder and, based on their type (audio, document, image), moves them to the corresponding subfolder. 
If the subfolder does not exist, the script creates it automatically. In addition to printing their information as you move them, the script keeps track of the files by creating
a recap.csv document with the same information.
