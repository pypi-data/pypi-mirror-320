Frugal generation of quadrature for polytopal domains

About
-----
polyquad is a tool that generates quadratures (or cubatures) for non
necessarily convex polytopal domains. Important points:
- the distribution of points is **shape independent**
- the number of integration points depends **only** on the polynomial
  order of the integrand
- expensive operations (QR decomposition) are done **only once per
  polynomial order**, their results are reused from one shape to the
  other
- integration points are defined on a bounding box encapsulating the
  polytope (and can thus **fall outside of the polytope**), so the
  integrand should be defined there as well.


## Installation

The package is deployed on pypi, so it can be installed simply using pip

```
pip install polyquad
```

*Note:* this package depends on `numba`. It seems that, at the moment,
it's not compatible with the latest python (3.13). Therefore you may
need to revert to an older python for a while.

## Usage
For a basic usage you have at your disposal 2 functions:
- `polyquad.get_quadrature_2d`
- `polyquad.get_quadrature_3d`

These should behave nicely as long as you feed them the right data
structures. We will explain these just after. Before we need to talk
about mapping.

### Mapping
Both `polyquad.get_quadrature_2d` and `polyquad.get_quadrature_3d`
come with an argument `mapping` which should be either True or False
(False is default).

I you use this library, chances are you already have a `bounding box`
concept in your code, thus your polytope is probably already lying in
its bounding box if so put `mapping = False` (or don't specify
anything as False is the default value) to avoid useless mappings.

On the contrary maybe your polytope isn't already in the reference
bounding box, in that case you should specify `mapping = True`.

### `polyquad.get_quadrature_2d`
As the name suggests, the function should be used to get quadratures
over a 2d polygon. Let us tackle the case of a simple pentagon:

We first need to declare the coordinates of vertices

```
verts = np.array(((1,-1), (-1,0), (0,3), (2,3), (3,0)))
```

Then we need to specify the ordering of vertices, which is quite
straightforward in that case

```
face = np.array((0,1,2,3,4))
```

Then, getting the quadrature for a polynomial order `k` is as simple as

```
points, weights = polyquad.get_quadrature_2d(k, verts, face, mapping = True)
```

### `polyquad.get_quadrature_3d`
This one is for polyhedra. The only difference lies the declaration of
faces. For sake of simplicity we here give the example of a simple
pyramid (this library is intended to be used with way more complex
polyhedra)

Again we first declare the coordinates of vertices

```
verts = np.array(((0,   0, 0),
                  (1,   0, 0),
                  (1,   1, 0),
                  (0,   1, 0),
                  (.5, .5, 1)))
```

Then we need to declare each planar face. A planar face is defined by
the list of the index of vertices comprising it. For example the
square base of the pyramid contains the four first vertices defined
above, so it is defined as : `[0,1,2,3]`
This is done for each face and gathered in a list of list as follows:

```
faces = [[0,1,2,3],
         [0,1,4],
         [1,2,4],
         [2,3,4],
         [3,0,4]]
```

**Note**: if the faces of the polyhedron all have the same number of
vertices then `faces` can be casted to a `np.array` of shape (number of
faces, number of vertices per face). This slightly speeds up the
computation.
