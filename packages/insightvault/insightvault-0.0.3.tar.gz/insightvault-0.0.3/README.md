**Insight Vault** is a local, privacy-focused library for building LLM-based applications. It allows you to store, search, and summarize text completely offline.

With **Insight Vault**, you can:

- **Search** your local knowledge base.
- **Chat** with your documents interactively.
- **Summarize** large sets of information into concise outputs.

All data stays **on your machine**, with no external API calls required.

For more details see the [documentation](https://daved01.github.io/insightvault/).

## üöÄ **Features**

- **Local Inference** ‚Äî Uses LLAMA for local LLM inference.
- **Local Embeddings** ‚Äî Embeddings are created using SentenceTransformers.
- **Privacy-first RAG** ‚Äî Store and query documents locally with ChromaDB.
- **Interactive CLI** ‚Äî Intuitive CLI interface for searching, managing, and summarizing.

## üì¶ **Dependencies**

The following dependencies are required to run **Insight Vault**:

- [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com/) ‚Äî For local LLM inference.
- [**ChromaDB**](https://docs.trychroma.com/) ‚Äî Local document storage and vector database.
- [**SentenceTransformers**](https://www.sbert.net/) ‚Äî Embeddings for better document search and query matching.

## üî• **Installation**

To install **Insight Vault**, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install insightvault
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Usage**

Insight Vault can be used via a simple CLI interface or as a Python library.

If you want to use the `chat` or `summarize` commands, you need to make sure that Ollama is running first.

### CLI

**Adding Documents**

```bash
insightvault manage add-file <path_to_document>
```

This command will add a file from the specified path to the local document database. You can also directly add text. The `manage` command is also used to list all documents, and to delete all documents.

**Searching Documents**

```bash
insightvault search "Explain RAG pipelines"
```

This will search your indexed documents for the query ‚ÄúExplain RAG pipelines‚Äù and return the most relevant results.

**Chat**

```bash
insightvault chat "Explain RAG pipelines"
```

This uses RAG which means it takes in a natural language query and returns a response in natural language based on the most relevant documents you have indexed.

**Summarizing Documents**

```bash
insightvault summarize "Explain RAG pipelines"
```

Summarizes the text you provide. The flag `--file` can be used to summarize a file.

### Library

Insightvault provides three apps as part of the library:

- `RAGApp` ‚Äî For RAG pipelines.
- `SearchApp` ‚Äî For searching indexed documents.
- `SummarizerApp` ‚Äî For summarizing text.

For example, to use the `SummarizerApp`, you can do the following:

```python
from insightvault import SummarizerApp

app = SummarizerApp()
await app.summarize("This is a loooong test")
```

See the [API Documentation](TODO!) for more information.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Development**

If you want to contribute to Insight Vault or run it locally for development, follow these steps.

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/daved01/insightvault.git
cd insightvault
```

2. Install Development Dependencies

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

This installs all required libraries for development, testing, and quality checks.

3. Run Tests

```bash
pytest tests
```

This runs all the unit and integration tests to ensure everything is working properly.

4. Run Quality Checks

We use ruff, mypy, and pre-commit hooks to ensure high code quality.

```bash
# Type checking with mypy
mypy insightvault

# Linting and formatting with ruff
ruff check . --fix
ruff format .
```

Pre-commit Hooks

To automatically check for secrets, format code, and run linters before every commit, set up pre-commit hooks as follows:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

This will install the hooks and run them automatically before each commit.
