## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Setup

Before using Jarvis, you need to set up your environment:

1. **API Key Configuration**

Create a `.jarvis_env` file in your home directory (`~/.jarvis_env`):

```bash
KIMI_API_KEY=your_kimi_api_key_here
```

To get your Kimi API key:
1. Visit [Kimi AI Platform](https://kimi.moonshot.cn) in your browser
2. Login to your account
3. Open browser Developer Tools (F12 or right-click -> Inspect)
4. Go to Network tab
5. Make any request (e.g., send a message)
6. Find a request to the Kimi API
7. Look for the `Authorization` header in the request headers
8. Copy the token value (remove the "Bearer " prefix)
9. Use this token as your `KIMI_API_KEY` in the `.jarvis_env` file

2. **Task Configuration (Optional)**

Create a `.jarvis` file in your working directory to define predefined tasks:

```yaml
# .jarvis
analyze_code: Analyze the code structure and quality in the current directory
fix_bugs: Help me find and fix potential bugs in the code
optimize: Suggest optimizations for the code
document: Generate documentation for the code
```

## üöÄ Installation

```bash
pip install jarvis-ai-assistant
```

## üí° Usage

1. **Basic Usage**
```bash
# Start Jarvis
jarvis

# Process specific files
jarvis -f file1.txt file2.py
```

2. **Using Predefined Tasks**

If you have a `.jarvis` file in your working directory:
```bash
# Jarvis will show available tasks on startup
# Select a task number or start a new conversation
```

3. **Interactive Features**
- Multi-line input support (press Enter twice to submit)
- File understanding and analysis
- Context-aware conversations
- Tool integration for system operations

4. **Environment Variables**
- `KIMI_API_KEY`: Your Kimi AI API key (required)
- Location: `~/.jarvis_env`
- Format: `KEY=value` (one per line)

5. **Task Configuration**
- File: `.jarvis` in working directory
- Format: `task_name: task_description`
- Purpose: Define commonly used tasks for quick access
- Example tasks:
  - Code analysis
  - Bug finding
  - Documentation generation
  - Performance optimization
