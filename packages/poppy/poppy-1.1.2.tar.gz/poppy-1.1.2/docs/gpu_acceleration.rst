GPU Accelerated Optical Calculations
====================================

.. admonition:: Placeholder docs

   This page is a placeholder for more complete documentation to be added later about 
   usage of GPUs for fast optical calculations.

Thanks to team members Kian Milani and Ewan Douglas (University of Arizona), poppy now 
includes a high performance option using NVidia GPUs to significantly accelerate optical 
calculations, in some cases by ~20x to 80x. 

This implementation seeks to perform all calculations on the GPU until the end of 
propagation. This reduces time for calculations as arrays no longer need to be transferred 
between GPU memory and standard memory when performing different calculations. It also 
allows GPU acceleration of the majority of calculations performed during an optical 
propagation (i.e. creating models of optical elements and applying them to wavefronts 
happens on the GPU, as well as the propagation calculations from one plane to another.)

An updated implementation using `CuPy <https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/overview.html>` 
replaces initial earlier support for CUDA using pyculib and numba.cuda. (That initial 
implementation has been removed since the CuPy implementation is much better performing.)

Note, because cupy is used as a replacement for numpy at import time, it is a bit tricky 
to toggle between GPU and CPU calculations during the same python session. Doing so is 
advanced usage, and while it can be useful in some cases for debugging or benchmarking, 
it's not fully supported or recommended to try to switch between calculation backends 
within the same session. 

**What about AMD GPUs?**

There also exists partial/earlier support for OpenCL for AMD GPUs, using the `pyopencl` 
and `gpyfft` packages. This provides much less performance gains than the CuPy version, 
however, since only  FFTs are performed on-GPU, not other parts of the optical propagation 
calculations.

**What about Apple Silicon GPUs?**

Poppy does not yet have support for the specialized GPU hardware in Apple Silicon M1/M2 
and similar. For these machines, plain numpy is the best option.


Requirements and Setup
----------------------

Requires NVidia GPU hardware

Requires CuPy > 10.0. Install from https://cupy.dev following the `CuPy installation docs 
<https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html#>`_

Also requires the cupyx GPU-accelerated version of scipy.


Performance Comparisons
-----------------------

Computation comparisons have been performed to illustrate the benefit of this accelerated 
computing feature. Below are comparisons of the times required for a PSF to be calculated 
for varying array sizes using the MKL FFT option versus the CuPy calculations. The optical 
systems tested had 5 different surfaces/optics. 

Performances will naturally vary depending on the compute hardware used. The system used 
for these comparisons was the University of Arizonaâ€™s HPC Puma nodes. The node utilized 
32 AMD EPYC 7642 CPUs and the NVIDIA Tesla V100S GPU.
