1. What versions of Polars are supported?

    Short answer: Polars <= **1.17.1** is supported.

    Longer answer: Since Polars has recently  [upgraded py03 to 0.23.x](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars/pull/20111) any many other dependencies still rely on 0.22.x, we are currently limited to Polars <= 1.17.1. We are working on upgrading to the latest version of Polars.
