# NumPack

NumPack is a high-performance array storage and manipulation library designed to efficiently handle large NumPy arrays. Built with Rust for performance and exposed to Python through PyO3, NumPack provides a seamless interface for storing, loading, and manipulating large numerical arrays with better performance compared to traditional NumPy storage methods.

## Features

- **High Performance**: Optimized for both reading and writing large numerical arrays
- **Memory Mapping Support**: Efficient memory usage through memory mapping capabilities
- **Selective Loading**: Load only the arrays you need, when you need them
- **In-place Operations**: Support for in-place array modifications without full file rewrite
- **Parallel I/O**: Utilizes parallel processing for improved performance
- **Multiple Data Types**: Supports various numerical data types including:
  - Boolean
  - Unsigned integers (8-bit to 64-bit)
  - Signed integers (8-bit to 64-bit)
  - Floating point (32-bit and 64-bit)

## Installation

```bash
pip install numpack
```

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.10
- NumPy

## Usage

### Basic Operations

```python
import numpy as np
from numpack import NumPack

# Create a NumPack instance
npk = NumPack("data_directory")

# Save arrays
arrays = {
    'array1': np.random.rand(1000, 100).astype(np.float32),
    'array2': np.random.rand(500, 200).astype(np.float32)
}
npk.save(arrays)

# Load arrays
# Normal mode
loaded = npk.load("array1")

# Memory mapping mode for large arrays
with npk.mmap_mode() as mmap_npk:
   # Access specific arrays
   array1 = mmap_npk.load('array1')
   array2 = mmap_npk.load('array2')
```

### Advanced Operations

```python
# Replace specific rows
replacement = np.random.rand(10, 100).astype(np.float32)
npk.replace({'array1': replacement}, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])  # Using list indices
npk.replace({'array1': replacement}, slice(0, 10))  # Using slice notation

# Append new arrays
new_arrays = {
    'array3': np.random.rand(200, 100).astype(np.float32)
}
npk.append(new_arrays)

# Drop arrays or specific rows
npk.drop('array1')  # Drop entire array
npk.drop(['array1', 'array2'])  # Drop multiple arrays
npk.drop('array2', [0, 1, 2])  # Drop specific rows

# Random access operations
data = npk.getitem('array1', [0, 1, 2])  # Access specific rows
data = npk.getitem('array1', slice(0, 10))  # Access using slice
data = npk['array1']  # Dictionary-style access for entire array

# Metadata operations
shapes = npk.get_shape()  # Get shapes of all arrays
shapes = npk.get_shape('array1')  # Get shape of specific array
members = npk.get_member_list()  # Get list of array names
mtime = npk.get_modify_time('array1')  # Get modification time
metadata = npk.get_metadata()  # Get complete metadata

# Stream loading for large arrays
for batch in npk.stream_load('array1', buffer_size=1000):
    # Process 1000 rows at a time
    process_batch(batch)

# Reset/clear storage
npk.reset()  # Clear all arrays

# Iterate over all arrays
for array_name in npk:
    data = npk[array_name]
    print(f"{array_name} shape: {data.shape}")
```

### Memory Mapping Mode

For large arrays, memory mapping mode provides more efficient memory usage:

```python
# Using memory mapping mode
with npk.mmap_mode() as mmap_npk:
    # Access specific arrays
    array1 = mmap_npk.load('array1')  # Array is not fully loaded into memory
    array2 = mmap_npk.load('array2')
    
    # Perform operations on memory-mapped arrays
    result = array1[0:1000] + array2[0:1000]
```

### Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Batch Operations**:
   - Prefer batch replacements over row-by-row operations when modifying multiple rows
   - Use `stream_load` for processing large arrays to control memory usage

2. **Memory Management**:
   - Use memory mapping mode for large arrays
   - Release array references when no longer needed

3. **Storage Optimization**:
   - Organize data structures efficiently to minimize modification frequency
   - Use `reset()` appropriately to clean up unnecessary data

## Performance

NumPack offers significant performance improvements compared to traditional NumPy storage methods, especially in data modification operations and random access. Below are detailed benchmark results:
