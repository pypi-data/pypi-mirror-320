# RAG Retriever

A Python application that loads and processes both web pages and local documents, indexing their content using embeddings, and enabling semantic search queries. Built with a modular architecture using OpenAI embeddings and Chroma vector store.

## What It Does

RAG Retriever enhances your AI coding assistant (like aider or Cursor) by giving it access to:

- Documentation about new technologies and features
- Your organization's architecture decisions and coding standards
- Internal APIs and tools documentation
- Any other knowledge that isn't part of the LLM's training data

This helps prevent hallucinations and ensures your AI assistant follows your team's practices.

> **💡 Note**: While our examples focus on AI coding assistants, RAG Retriever can enhance any AI-powered development environment or tool that can execute command-line applications. Use it to augment IDEs, CLI tools, or any development workflow that needs reliable, up-to-date information.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10-3.12 (Download from [python.org](https://python.org))
- pipx (Install with one of these commands):

  ```bash
  # On MacOS
  brew install pipx

  # On Windows/Linux
  python -m pip install --user pipx
  ```

### System Requirements

The application uses Playwright with Chromium for web crawling:

- Chromium browser is automatically installed during package installation
- Sufficient disk space for Chromium (~200MB)
- Internet connection for initial setup and crawling

Note: The application will automatically download and manage Chromium installation.

## Installation

Install RAG Retriever as a standalone application:

```bash
pipx install rag-retriever
```

This will:

- Create an isolated environment for the application
- Install all required dependencies
- Install Chromium browser automatically
- Make the `rag-retriever` command available in your PATH

## How to Upgrade

To upgrade RAG Retriever to the latest version:

```bash
pipx upgrade rag-retriever
```

This will:

- Upgrade the package to the latest available version
- Preserve your existing configuration and data
- Update any new dependencies automatically

After installation, initialize the configuration:

```bash
# Initialize configuration files
rag-retriever --init
```

This creates:

- A configuration file at `~/.config/rag-retriever/config.yaml` (Unix/Mac) or `%APPDATA%\rag-retriever\config.yaml` (Windows)
- A `.env` file in the same directory for your OpenAI API key

### Setting up your API Key

Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### Customizing Configuration

All settings are in `config.yaml`. For detailed information about all configuration options, best practices, and example configurations, see our [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration-guide.md).

Key configuration sections include:

```yaml
# Vector store settings
vector_store:
  embedding_model: "text-embedding-3-large"
  embedding_dimensions: 3072
  chunk_size: 1000
  chunk_overlap: 200

# Local document processing
document_processing:
  supported_extensions:
    - ".md"
    - ".txt"
    - ".pdf"
  pdf_settings:
    max_file_size_mb: 50
    extract_images: false
    ocr_enabled: false
    languages: ["eng"]
    strategy: "fast"
    mode: "elements"

# Search settings
search:
  default_limit: 8
  default_score_threshold: 0.3
```

### Data Storage

The vector store database is stored at:

- Unix/Mac: `~/.local/share/rag-retriever/chromadb/`
- Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\rag-retriever\chromadb/`

This location is automatically managed by the application and should not be modified directly.

### Uninstallation

To completely remove RAG Retriever:

```bash
# Remove the application and its isolated environment
pipx uninstall rag-retriever

# Remove Playwright browsers
python -m playwright uninstall chromium

# Optional: Remove configuration and data files
# Unix/Mac:
rm -rf ~/.config/rag-retriever ~/.local/share/rag-retriever
# Windows (run in PowerShell):
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:APPDATA\rag-retriever"
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:LOCALAPPDATA\rag-retriever"
```

document_processing:
  # Supported file extensions
  supported_extensions:
    - ".md"
    - ".txt"
    - ".pdf"

  # Patterns to exclude from processing
  excluded_patterns:
    - ".*"
    - "node_modules/**"
    - "__pycache__/**"

    strategy: "fast" # Options: fast, accurate
    mode: "elements" # Options: single_page, paged, elements
```

### Content Processing Settings

```yaml
content:
  chunk_size: 2000
  chunk_overlap: 400
  # Text splitting separators (in order of preference)
  separators:
    - "\n## " # h2 headers (strongest break)
    - "\n### " # h3 headers
    - "\n#### " # h4 headers
    - "\n- " # bullet points
    - "\n• " # alternative bullet points
    - "\n\n" # paragraphs
    - ". " # sentences (weakest break)
```

### Search Settings

```yaml
search:
  default_limit: 8 # Default number of results
  default_score_threshold: 0.3 # Minimum relevance score
```

### Browser Settings (Web Crawling)

```yaml
browser:
  wait_time: 2 # Base wait time in seconds
  viewport:
    width: 1920
    height: 1080
  delays:
    before_request: [1, 3] # Min and max seconds
    after_load: [2, 4]
    after_dynamic: [1, 2]
  launch_options:
    headless: true
    channel: "chrome"
  context_options:
    bypass_csp: true
    java_script_enabled: true
```

## Understanding Search Results

Search results include relevance scores based on cosine similarity:

- Scores range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates perfect similarity
- Default threshold is 0.3 (configurable via `search.default_score_threshold`)
- Typical interpretation:
  - 0.7+: Very high relevance (nearly exact matches)
  - 0.6 - 0.7: High relevance
  - 0.5 - 0.6: Good relevance
  - 0.3 - 0.5: Moderate relevance
  - Below 0.3: Lower relevance

## Features

- **Local Document Loading**: Load markdown, text, and PDF files from local directories.

  - **Single File and Directory Loading**: Easily load individual files or entire directories with support for multithreading and progress indication.
  - **PDF Processing**: Extract text and images from PDFs using multiple loaders, with optional OCR for scanned documents.
  - **Configurable Settings**: Customize supported file types, PDF processing options, and more through configuration files.

- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for unsupported file types and missing files, with detailed logging for troubleshooting.

- **Configuration**: Flexible configuration options for document processing, including supported extensions and PDF settings.

## Dependencies

Key dependencies include:

- openai: For embeddings generation (text-embedding-3-large model)
- chromadb: Vector store implementation with cosine similarity
- selenium: JavaScript content rendering
- beautifulsoup4: HTML parsing
- python-dotenv: Environment management

## Notes

- Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model for generating embeddings by default
- Content is automatically cleaned and structured during indexing
- Implements URL depth-based crawling control
- Vector store persists between runs unless explicitly deleted
- Uses cosine similarity for more intuitive relevance scoring
- Minimal output by default with `--verbose` flag for troubleshooting
- Full content display by default with `--truncate` option for brevity
- ⚠️ Changing chunk size/overlap settings after ingesting content may lead to inconsistent search results. Consider reprocessing existing content if these settings must be changed.

## Future Development

RAG Retriever is under active development with many planned improvements. We maintain a detailed roadmap of future enhancements in our [Future Features](docs/future-features.md) document, which outlines:

- Document lifecycle management improvements
- Integration with popular documentation platforms
- Vector store analysis and visualization
- Search quality enhancements
- Performance optimizations

While the current version is fully functional for core use cases, there are currently some limitations that will be addressed in future releases. Check the future features document for details on potential upcoming improvements.
