# Regular expression to match an email address compliant with RFC 5322
# (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.4.1).  This regular
# expression has two parts: the part before the `@`, and the part
# after the `@`.  There are two alternatives for the part before the
# `@`: it can either consist of a series of letters, digits and
# certain symbols, including one or more dots.  However, dots may not
# appear consecutively or at the start or end of the email address.
# The other alternative requires the part before the `@` to be
# enclosed in double quotes, allowing any string of ASCII characters
# between the quotes.  Whitespace characters, double quotes and
# backslashes must be escaped with backslashes.
#
# The part after the `@` also has two alternatives.  It can either
# be a fully qualified domain name (e.g., `somehost.example.com`).
# The literal Internet address can either be an IP address, or a
# domain-specific routing address.  This regular expression omits the
# syntax using double quotes and square brackets, as RFC 2822 marks
# this notation as obsolete.
