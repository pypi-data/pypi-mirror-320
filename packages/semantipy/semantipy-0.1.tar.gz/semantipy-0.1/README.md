# Semantipy

## Overview
 
semantipy is a powerful Python library designed for semantic data manipulation and processing.
It provides a comprehensive set of operations that enable developers, data scientists, and researchers to work with semantic objects in a flexible and intuitive manner.
Whether you're dealing with natural language processing tasks, building AI applications, or performing semantic analysis, semantipy simplifies the complexities involved in handling semantic data.

## Highlights
 
* **Flexible API:** A rich set of functions designed for various semantic operations.
* **Easy Integration:** Seamlessly incorporate semantic processing into your Python projects.
* **Extensible:** Build upon semantipy's core functions to create complex semantic workflows.
* **Versatile:** Handle a mix of semantic objects and strings effortlessly.
* **Contextual Processing:** Supports context management for more accurate semantic operations.

## Who Should Use semantipy?

* Developers working on applications that require advanced semantic data manipulation.
* Data Scientists who need tools for processing and analyzing semantic information.
* Researchers focusing on natural language processing and semantic analysis.
* AI Practitioners looking to build intelligent systems that understand and manipulate semantics.


## Installation
 
Install semantipy using pip:

```
pip install semantipy
```

## Quickstart

Here's a quick example to get you started with semantipy:

```python
from semantipy import apply, resolve, select, combine, contains

# Apply a transformation to a semantic object
result = apply("apple_banana_cherry", "banana", "replace with grape")
print(result)  # Output: apple_grape_cherry

# Resolve a semantic expression
capital = resolve("What's the capital of Russia?")
print(capital)  # Output: Moscow

# Select elements from semantic content
number = select("Natalia sold 48+24 = 72 clips altogether.", int)
print(number)  # Output: 72

# Combine multiple semantic objects
combined = combine("AI, Cloud, Productivity", "Computing, Gaming & Apps")
print(combined)  # Output: AI, Cloud, Productivity, Computing, Gaming & Apps

# Check if a semantic object contains another
is_contained = contains("intention to order a flight", "I want to book a flight from Seattle to London")
print(is_contained)  # Output: True
```
