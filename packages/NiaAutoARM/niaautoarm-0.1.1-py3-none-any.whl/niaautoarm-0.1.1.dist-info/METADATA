# NiaAutoARM

A novel AutoML method for automatically constructing the full association rule mining pipelines based on stochastic population-based metaheuristics.

## About

The numerical association rule mining paradigm that includes concurrent dealing with numerical and categorical attributes is beneficial for discovering associations from datasets that consist of both features. The process is not considered as easy since it incorporates several components that form an entire pipeline, i.e., preprocessing, algorithm selection, hyperparameter optimization, and the definition of metrics that evaluate the quality of the association rule. NiaAutoARM software aims to automatize this process and reduce the need for the user's effort to discover association rules.

## How it works?

See the following [preprint](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.00138) for more information.

## Installation üì¶
