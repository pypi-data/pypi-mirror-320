Motor
=====

Controlling the motors directly is not very precise because the NXT firmware
does not expose the needed method for precise control. If you need more than
basic controls, :class:`nxt.motcont.MotCont` provides finer controls thanks to
a program running on the NXT brick.

Work in progress... The :class:`nxt.motor.Motor` class will probably be
reworked in a future version.
