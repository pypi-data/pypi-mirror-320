## Thanks

- Doug Lau for writing NXT\_Python, our starting point.
- rhn for creating what would become v2, making lots of smaller changes, and
  reviewing tons of code.
- Marcus Wanner for maintaining NXT-Python up to v2.2.2, his work has been
  amazing!
- Elvin Luff for taking over the project after Marcus, making a lot of work
  for the port to Python 3.
- mindsensors.com (esp. Ryan Kneip) for helping out with the code for a lot of
  their sensors, expanding the sensors covered by the type checking database,
  and providing hardware for testing.
- HiTechnic for providing identification information for their sensors. I note
  that they have now included this information in their website. ;)
- Linus Atorf, Samuel Leeman-Munk, melducky, Simon Levy, Steve Castellotti,
