Are you looking for scripts that were located in this directory? They are now
part of the nxt package and generated on installation.

If NXT-Python is installed on your system, you can run them by typing their
names (nxt-push, nxt-server, nxt-screenshot or nxt-test).

If NXT-Python is not installed, the easiest way to run them is by using poetry
from somewhere in the source directory like this for example:

    poetry run nxt-test

You can get help with:

    poetry run nxt-test --help
