## Titans - Pytorch (wip)

Unofficial implementation of [Titans](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00663) in Pytorch. Will also contain some explorations into architectures beyond their simple 1-4 layer MLP for the neural memory module, if it works well to any degree.

## Install

```bash
$ pip install titans-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from titans_pytorch import NeuralMemory

x = torch.randn(2, 64, 32)

mem = NeuralMemory(32)

out = mem(x)

assert x.shape == out.shape
```
