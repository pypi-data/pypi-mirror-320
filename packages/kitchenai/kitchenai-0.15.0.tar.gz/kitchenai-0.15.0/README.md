## üöÄ **What is KitchenAI?**  

KitchenAI is an open-source toolkit that simplifies AI complexities by acting as your **AI backend** and **LLMOps solution**‚Äîfrom experimentation to production.  

It empowers **developers** to focus on delivering results without getting stuck in the weeds of AI infrastructure, observability, or deployment.  

### **Key Goals**:  
1. **Simplify AI Integration**: Easily turn AI experiments into production-ready APIs.  
2. **Provide an AI Backend**: Handle the entire AI lifecycle‚Äîexperimentation, observability, and scaling.  
3. **Empower Developers**: Focus on application building, not infrastructure.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Who is KitchenAI For?**  

- **Application Developers**:  
   - Seamlessly integrate AI into your apps using APIs.  
   - Experiment and test AI techniques without reinventing the wheel.  

- **AI Developers & Data Scientists**:  
   - Move quickly from Jupyter notebooks to production-ready services.  
   - Deploy custom AI techniques with ease (e.g., RAG, embeddings).  

- **Platform & Infra Engineers**:  
   - Customize your AI stack, integrate tools like Sentry, OpenTelemetry, and more.  
   - Scale and optimize AI services with a modular, extensible framework.

**Say goodbye to boilerplate!**  

## üöÄ **Go from notebook to app integration in minutes.**
Example notebook: [kitchenai-community/llama_index_starter](https://github.com/epuerta9/kitchenai-community/blob/main/src/kitchenai_community/llama_index_starter/notebook.ipynb)

By annotating your notebook with KitchenAI annotations, you can go from this:

## üí° **Why KitchenAI?**  

Integrating and scaling AI is **too complex** today. KitchenAI solves this:  

1. **AI Backend Ready to Go**:  
   - Stop building APIs and infra from scratch. Deploy AI code as production-ready APIs in minutes.  

2. **Built-In LLMOps Features**:  
   - Observability, tracing, and evaluation tools are pre-configured.  

3. **Framework-Agnostic & Extensible**:  
   - Vendor-neutral, open-source, and easy to customize with plugins.  

4. **Faster Time-to-Production**:  
   - Go from experimentation to live deployments seamlessly.  

---

## ‚ö° **Quickstart**  

1. **Set Up Environment**  
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key>
   export KITCHENAI_DEBUG=True
   python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate && pip install kitchenai
   ```

2. **Start a Project**  
   ```bash
   kitchenai cook list && kitchenai cook select llama-index-chat && pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   ![kitchenai-list](docs/_static/images/kitchenai-list.gif)
   

3. **Run the Server**  
   ```bash
   kitchenai init && kitchenai dev --module app:kitchen
   ```
   Alternatively, you can run the server with jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   kitchenai dev --module app:kitchen --jupyter
   ```

4. **Test the API**  
   ```bash
   kitchenai client health
   ```
   ```bash
   kitchenai client labels
   ```

5. **Build Docker Container**  
   ```bash
   kitchenai build . app:kitchenai
   ```
