1	course catalog	N			2.2		das Vorlesungsverzeichnis		-se											We present a simple note first because most of the notes in this example file are meant to provide suggestions in all the edge cases users may encounter, but there is nothing wrong with having simple cards where only `input_note_id`, `en1`, `de1`, and `de2` are populated.
2	eight	O			1.7		acht													An even simpler note for a cardinal number where `de2` is also empty.
3	stay, remain	V			1.2		bleiben		bleibt, blieb, ist geblieben								der Esel sagt ihm, dass er nicht allein zu bleiben braucht			(1) The number of tokens in `de1` don’t need to match those in `en1`. (2) This note also has an example sentence from Deutsch im Blick where the audio can be linked, so it is put in `dib_sentences`. If this is a sentence that we wanted to make ourselves translate when studying the note, a prompt in `de3_prompt` would have been added. (But this is not done since the sentence is very complex for Chapter 1.)
4	student	N	UNI		1.2,2.1		der Student, die Studentin		-en [n-dekl], -nen			ich bin Student	I am a student							(1) For masculine nouns with plural ending -n or -en, it seems useful to put in `de2` either ‘[n-dekl]’ or ‘[not: n-dekl]’; (2) For words in earlier chapters, we present the masculine and feminine forms in separate tokens of `de1`. In later chapters, the feminine form is indicated simply by an ‘(in)’ ending after the masculine form, although both plurals are still shown as a reminder.
6	come	V			1.4,6		kommen		kommt, kam, ist gekommen		see also: come from									We deliberately skip input_note_id=5 in this example file to emphasize that `input_note_id` should uniquely identify a row in this file, but gaps in the sequence are ok. `input_note_id` will be used by the flashcard software to identify the note, so users should not change the numbers of notes once they are created.
7	come (from somewhere)	V			1.4,6.51		kommen (aus D)					ich komme aus den USA	I come from the U.S.					kommen aus		The audio file to be linked will be associated with the headword ‘kommen aus’, so ‘kommen aus’ is added to `de_xref`.
8	cell phone	N	TECH		1.12		das Handy		-s			was ist deine Handynummer?	what is your (inf) cell phone number?							The prompt indicates whether 'you' is formal or informal. (2) The plural ending is deliberately omitted from `de2`. The sample program will therefore identify this record in the de2_prob.txt output listing.
9	professor	N	PROF,UNI	STMPL	2.1,8.7		der Professor, die Professorin	stress moves: Prof[e]ssor, -fess[[o]]ren	-en, -nen	give one masc. and one fem. word										(1) The `de_pronun` field indicates moving stress. (2) The `de1_hint` gives a hint that will be printed with the prompt for `de1` along with `en1`, `part_of_speech`, and the number of target answers in the `de1` field.
10	drink	V	FOOD		3.2,8.3		trinken ([etw])		trinkt, trank, getrunken			einen Kaffee trinken gehen; ein Bier trinken gehen	go for a coffee; go for a beer							
11	career counselor	N	PROF		8.7,9.3		der Berufsberater(in)		-, -nen											See previous note for ‘student’.
12	dream (about sb/sth)	V			8.3,10.57		träumen ([von jdm/etw])		wk			ich hab' von dir geträumt	I dreamed about you (inf).							For more advanced verbs, listing the principal forms of a verb in `de2` can be replaced with ‘wk’ for a weak verb and ‘sg’ for a strong verb (where the ending should already be known). However, if the verb begins with a prefix that can be separable or inseparable, the third person present should be given to indicate this. The example program will generate a warning if the prefix is not found in the appropriate token of `de2` (e.g., for the next note, ‘surprise’).
13	surprise (sb)	V			9.2		überraschen (jdn)		wk											
14	immediately	A	TIME		10.51		sofort, gleich				1: immediately, 2: in a minute									We have put these two words with slightly different meanings on the same card with the different meanings indicated in `de3`, but different notes could have been made instead.
15	butterfly	N	ANIMAL				der Schmetterling		-e			Schmetterlinge/Flugzeuge im Bauch haben	have butterflies in one’s stomach (and give the same expression with another noun)					die Schmetterlinge (Pl.)		'der Schmetterling’ is a perfectly valid singular noun, but the reference presents the plural form in its vocabulary list and audio pronunciation. This is likely to be a problem if a different reference has ‘der Schmetterling’ as a singular form in their list. We therefore put one of the forms in `de1` and the other form in `de_xref`. This note chooses to put the singular in `de1` and therefore `en1` gives the singular translation. The next note presents the example where the alternate is chosen.
16	butterflies	N	ANIMAL		8.3		die Schmetterlinge (Pl.)		___			Schmetterlinge/Flugzeuge im Bauch haben	have butterflies in one’s stomach (and give the same expression with another noun)					der Schmetterling		See previous note for ‘butterfly’
17	get dressed	V	CLOTHING		7.51		sich anziehen		zieht sich an, zog sich an, sich angezogen			non-refl = put on (some piece of clothing) (etw)	also give non-refl definition	VBZIEHEN						An example where `en1` has a reflexive translation. A prompt to give the meaning of the verb without the reflexive pronoun is also given in `de3_prompt`. (2) The next four notes are all verbs containing the base form ‘ziehen’. Because it is common when learning to confuse the meanings of these words with similar bases, the string ‘VBZIEHEN’ is placed in `de_conf`, and the example python program replaces this with a string giving the five German words/phrases with this base and their translation.
18	get undressed	V	CLOTHING		7.51		sich ausziehen		zieht sich aus, zog sich aus, sich ausgezogen			non-refl = take off (some piece of clothing) (etw)	also give non-refl definition	VBZIEHEN						See Comment (2) on ‘get dressed’ note for explanation of de_conf=’VBZIEHEN’.
19	get changed	V	CLOTHING		7.51		sich umziehen		sg					VBZIEHEN						See Comment (2) on ‘get dressed’ note for explanation of de_conf=’VBZIEHEN’. See ‘dream’ note for explanation of de3=’sg’.
20	single mother	N	FAM		9.2		alleinerziehende Mutter							VBZIEHEN						(1) See Comment (2) on ‘get dressed’ note for explanation of de_conf=’VBZIEHEN’. This is part_of_speech='N' and `de2` is empty, so the example program will put the record in the de2_problems.txt problem listing.
21	raise children	V	FAM		9.2		Kinder erziehen		sg					VBZIEHEN						See Comment (2) on ‘get dressed’ note for explanation of de_conf=’VBZIEHEN’. See ‘dream’ note for explanation of de3=’sg’.
22	roll (of bread)	N	FOOD		3.2		das Brötchen		-						die Semmel (-n)	die Semmel (-n)				An example with alternate words commonly used in Austria and Switzerland (although actually 'die Semmel' is an Austrian word we have included in both fields for testing). Typically the front side of the note when studying a card indicates the number of tokens in `de1` not marked with ‘°’, but when `at1` or `sd1` is populated, the number of tokens in the `at1` and/or `sd1` fields are also given.
23	which (question-word)	A			2.53,1.54		welch-											welcher; welches; welche; welchen		Determiners or adjectives used only attributively may be presented in different reference lists with different endings (welcher, welche).
24	face	N	BODY		7.4		das Gesicht		-er			sich das Gesicht waschen (sich D); die Gesichtscreme (-s)	wash one’s ~; ~ cream	das Gericht (-e) = dish, meal						(1) Tildes can be used to replace the translation of the headword in `de3_prompt`. They could also be used to replace the headword in the expressions in `de3`, but this should only be done if there is no audio file to link to, which is not the case here. (2) `de_conf`is used to indicate an unrelated German word that we might confuse the answer with.
25	dish, meal	N	FOOD		3.5		das Gericht		-e					das Gesicht (-er) = face						`de_conf` is used to indicate an unrelated German word that we might confuse the answer with.
26	calorie	A	MED		7.1		die Kalorie	Kalor[[ie]] (-ee), Kalor[[i]]en	-n			kalorienarm; kalorienreich°	low in calories; high in calories°							Answers marked with ‘°’ are optional in the sense that we try to say the answer, but if we do not consider the card wrong if we cannot produce the answer. We may in the future add code to generate cards for each such token marked with ° where the prompt is the German expression and the answer is the corresponding token in `de3_prompt`, so it is recommended to keep the same number of tokens in these fields when ‘°’ is used.
27	the Netherlands	N	GEO		1.5		die Niederlande (Pl.), Holland (ugs)°		___, ___			in die Niederlande reisen; in den Niederlanden wohnen	travel to ~; live in ~							Answers marked with ‘°’ are optional in the sense that we try to say the answer, but if we do not consider the card wrong if we cannot produce the answer. The example program generates a field that will be one of the rows in the prompt (the front of the flashcard) as ‘N1/N2’ where N1 is the count of tokens in DE1 not marked with ‘°’ and N2 is the total number of tokens in `de1`. If N1=N2, then the prompt is ‘N1’. (2) ‘(ugs)’ in `de1` is an abbreviation for ‘umgangssprache’ (informal speech)
28	comedy	N	AV		4.9		die Komödie	Kom[[ö]]die (-ee-uh)	-n											Nouns ending in ‘-ie’ can have either an IPA ‘iː’ or ‘i̯ə’ sound. We indicate this in the example as ‘(-ee)’ or ‘(-ee-uh)’ in `de_pronun`. See also note for ‘calorie’.
29	crazy	A	PQ		4.11,10.51,5.2		verrückt, wahnsinnig, irre (ugs)°					3=1								There are several words meaning ‘crazy’. See ‘the Netherlands’ note for meaning of ‘°’ and ‘(ugs)’. In `de3`, the ‘3=1’ shorthand is used to indicate the third token in `de1` has the same meaning as the first. In the future, the package may be updated to automatically generate notes for study from such shorthand. The words ‘verrückt’ and ‘wahnsinning’ are not synonyms, and so a learner would typically find the difference in meanings and put the answer in `de3`.
30	siblings	N	FAM		5.1		die Geschwister (Pl.)		___			nur Plural								A word with no singular form widely used in German, so it is entered in the plural form. The card could also be constructed with the rare singular form in `de1` and a note in `de3`, as was done above for the ‘butterfly’ note. This latter case might be better if the learner has other languages in their source spreadsheet, in which case ‘sibling’ in the singular likely exists in those languages.
31	Italy	N	GEO		1.5		Italien		___											A noun with no plural. As on other notes, ‘___’ or some other convention set by the user (‘_’, ‘<>’) can indicate no plural exists. A learner could even choose to use different strings for different situations (e.g., singular word in `de1` with no plural is '<>', whereas if the plural form is in `de1`, then put '___' in `de2`), but we do not do this.
32	look forward to (sth)	V			7.51		sich auf etw A freuen		wk: freut sich auf etw A			ich freue mich auf (etw A)	I am looking forward to (sth)					sich freuen		The learner must choose a convention for how to record reflexive verbs in `de1`, and especially reflexive verbs with additional complements. We adopt the convention to present the reflexive pronoun and other complements before the infinitive when the verb is reflexive. For non-reflexive verbs, objects are in parentheses after the verb. It is a good idea to have expressions in `de3` that give conjugated expressions for such reflexive verbs so that learners practice the right order for the conjugated form as well. It may be that a different resource presents the headword as 'sich freuen', and therefore this string is in `de_xref`.
33	help	V		DDO	6.51		helfen (jdm/etw)		hilft, half, geholfen											DE1 indicates the objects of the verbs, indicating that the person being helped would be in the dative case. This is also indicated by the ‘DDO’ value in `de_cat`.
34	relative, family member	N	FAM		5.1		der/die Verwandte(r), das Familienmitglied		-n/-, -er											Adjectives declined as nouns are presented as ‘der/die ...(r)’, with ‘-n/-’ plural.
35	against	A			2.54		gegen [acc.]					gegen X rebellieren; was hast du gegen mich?	rebel against X; what do you have against me?							The case taken by the preposition is given in `de1`. `de3` would also have some typical key examples.
36	yoghurt	N	FOOD		3.2		der Joghurt		-s		das Joghurt used in N Germany									No prompt for `de3` information is added in `de_add_en`. Therefore, we will consider the card correct even if we do not identify the regional differences when studying the card.
37	expensive	A			4.11,6,8.51,8.52		teuer		teurer, die teuerste/am teuersten			sauteuer	very expensive (but not: ‘sehr ~’)							If comparative or superlative is irregular or umlauts, then comparative and superlative forms are listed in `de2`.
38	hard, tough	A			8.51		hart		härter, die härteste/am härtesten											If comparative or superlative is irregular or umlauts, then comparative and superlative forms are listed in `de2`.
39	unconscious	A	MED		7.7		bewusstlos													
40	salty	A	FOOD		8.51		salzig													Adjectives with regular comparative and superlative forms have `de2` empty.
41	novel	N	READ		F3	F3	der Roman		-e											An example where `dech` is not a number. In our example, we use numbers in `dech` to indicate the chapter in the first book we use to study (Deutsch im Blick). For chapter(s) from the next book(s) or resource(s) used after Deutsch im Blick, we must add some prefix and the example program shows how to convert this to a number. (For example, Chapters 1-10 in Book ‘F’ are converted to Chapters 11-20 in the program ouptut so that each numeric chapter refers only one book/resource.) This word is actually in Chapter 10 of Deutsch im Blick, but for testing, we pretend it is in Chapter 3 of Book F. 
42	crosswalk	N	CITY				der Zebrastreifen		-											This word is also actually in Chapter 10 of Deutsch im Blick, but for testing we omit the chapter assignment and omit the word from the reference list. A word not in any reference list and dech='' will have the chapter assigned to the default maximum by the program.
43	pink	A	COLOR		1.9		rosa		no comp. or endings											If comparative and superlatives do not exist, this is mentioned in `de2`
44	partner	N																		
45	talk about the weather	V	UNI		6		über das Wetter sprechen		wk										sprechen	This note is just to illustrate the `de_xref_audio` field. We pretend we don't have audio for 'über das Wetter sprechen' (Chapter 6) but do for 'sprechen' (Chapter 2). We would like to hear the pronunciation of 'sprechen' without having the chapter for 'sprechen' assigned to this note.
