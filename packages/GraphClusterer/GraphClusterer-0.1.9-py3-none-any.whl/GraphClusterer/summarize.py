Instructions:
You have received the texts to summarize, separated by '<New Text>' between each consecutive pair of texts.
You will summarize the texts according to the following rules:
1- You must not directly reference any of the texts.
2- Your summary must be between 5-10 sentences long.
3- Your summary must mention key ideas and concepts that repeat in the texts.
4- You must not invent any information. The summary must contain only information directly deduced from the texts.
5- Your summary must be coherent, fluent in language, and relevant in content to the texts.
6- In your summary, only refer to the texts you get as input, do not make things up in the summary.
7- Try your best that the summary will be the most relevant, coherent, consistent and as fluent as can be.
8- Do not use characters that are outside the standard ASCII range.

Texts:
"""

LLAMA_PROMPT_1 = """
Instructions:

You will receive an input that contains both a summary. Your task is:
   - Remove any references to the original source (e.g., phrases like "in the article," "this text," or "the provided 
   review") or any wording that refers back to the original document.
   - After removing these references, rewrite the summary as a single paragraph without line breaks. Maintain the 
   original content without adding any new words or altering the meaning.

Important Rules:
- Do not introduce any additional words to the summary.
- Ensure the summary remains concise and free of references to the original text.
- You will not say anything else.
- Do not use characters that are outside the standard ASCII range.

Summary input:

"""

LLAMA_PROMPT_2 = """
Instructions:

- You are getting a text as an input.
- You will generate a title for it.
- The title should be 4 words max.
- The title must capture the unique concepts in the text.
- Do not introduce any additional words to the text.

For example:
If the text is about how to bake a cake, your answer will be "How to bake a cake".

Important Rules:
Do not add to your answer any introductions such as "This is one suggestion for naming this text:" or 
"Here is a potential title for the text:" etc.
Do not use characters that are outside the standard ASCII range.
