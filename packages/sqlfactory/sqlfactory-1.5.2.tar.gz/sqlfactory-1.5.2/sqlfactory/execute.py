    This is the base class for an executable SQL statement that does not have any arguments.

    This class implements the execute() method. When given a database driver (or cursor) with query() or execute()
    methods, which take an SQL statement as the first argument and then a tuple or variadic arguments following SQL
    argument, it can be used to directly execute the SQL statement. This saves some typing by avoiding the manual
    passing of a string statement and arguments to the query.

    DB-API 2.0 drivers/cursors should all work with this implementation, as cursors should have execute() methods with
    the described semantics.

    Even async is supported. As this class does not process the result of the SQL statement in any way, the return
    value of the driver's execute()/query() method is directly returned. That returned value can be awaitable for async
    methods, so you can directly await it.
