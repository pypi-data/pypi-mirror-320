Armada is a lightweight tool designed for centralized network log viewing across multiple data sources. It provides quick and detailed insights into network flows enriched with metadata.

Originally created to analyze VMware NSX logs, its broader goal is to become a versatile tool for general network log analysis.

## Features

- Simple setup process. There is no need for complex configurations or additional servers;
- Search query suggestions and autocompletion;
- Log correlation with relevant asset data;
- Current Data Source Support:
  - VMware Aria Operations for Logs
  - VMware Aria Operations for Networks
  - Ivanti Neurons (HEAT) for ITSM
  - IBM QRadar
