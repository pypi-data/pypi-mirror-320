# Adaptive Classifier

A flexible, adaptive classification system that allows for dynamic addition of new classes and continuous learning from examples. Built on top of transformers from HuggingFace, this library provides an easy-to-use interface for creating and updating text classifiers.

## Features

- ðŸš€ Works with any transformer classifier model
- ðŸ“ˆ Continuous learning capabilities
- ðŸŽ¯ Dynamic class addition
- ðŸ’¾ Safe and efficient state persistence
- ðŸ”„ Prototype-based learning
- ðŸ§  Neural adaptation layer

## Installation

```bash
pip install adaptive-classifier
```

## Quick Start

```python
from adaptive_classifier import AdaptiveClassifier

# Initialize with any HuggingFace model
classifier = AdaptiveClassifier("bert-base-uncased")

# Add some examples
texts = [
    "The product works great!",
    "Terrible experience",
    "Neutral about this purchase"
]
labels = ["positive", "negative", "neutral"]

classifier.add_examples(texts, labels)

# Make predictions
predictions = classifier.predict("This is amazing!")
print(predictions)  # [('positive', 0.85), ('neutral', 0.12), ('negative', 0.03)]

# Save the classifier
classifier.save("./my_classifier")

# Load it later
loaded_classifier = AdaptiveClassifier.load("./my_classifier")
```

## Advanced Usage

### Adding New Classes Dynamically

```python
# Add a completely new class
new_texts = [
    "Error code 404 appeared",
    "System crashed after update"
]
new_labels = ["technical"] * 2

classifier.add_examples(new_texts, new_labels)
```

### Continuous Learning

```python
# Add more examples to existing classes
more_examples = [
    "Best purchase ever!",
    "Highly recommend this"
]
more_labels = ["positive"] * 2

classifier.add_examples(more_examples, more_labels)
```

## How It Works

The system combines three key components:

1. **Transformer Embeddings**: Uses state-of-the-art language models for text representation

2. **Prototype Memory**: Maintains class prototypes for quick adaptation to new examples

3. **Adaptive Neural Layer**: Learns refined decision boundaries through continuous training

- PyTorch â‰¥ 2.0
- transformers â‰¥ 4.30.0
