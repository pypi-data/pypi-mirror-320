# pybit_ms

This library is a modification of the official **pybit** library, designed to facilitate trading automation and analysis.

---

## Installation Instructions

Install the library using `pip` with the following command:

```bash
pip install pybit_ms
```

---

## Usage example

Import the BybitAPI class required for interacting with the Bybit's API:

```python
from pybit_ms import BybitAPI    
```    

<br>

### 1. Public endpoint:


First we show how to query a public endpoint, i.e. one that does not require profile authentication. In this example we implement the get_tickers() function which queries the latest price snapshot, best bid/ask price, and trading volume in the last 24 hours.

Initialize the BybitAPI class wit:

```python
api = BybitAPI()
```

and query with parameters of your choice, for example spot trade, and coin pair BTC-USDT:

```python
api.market.get_tickers(category="spot", symbol="BTCUSDT")
```
<br>

This will display an html table like the one below:

![](/images/html.png)

In case we are only interested in the price we can set the only_ticker parameter to True, or set the raw parameter to True for the complete raw request response.



### 2. Private endpoint:

To query a private endpoint we need to pass our API keys as parameters in the intial BybitAPI client class. Store the API keys in two string variables: public_key and private_key.

Initialize the BybitAPI client class with:

```python
api = BybitAPI(testnet=True, api_key=public_key, api_secret=private_key)
```

<br>

Note: 
* it is always good practice to store the actual keys in a separate file and read them from there when necessary (refer to read_api_keys.py file in the examples folder for an example of how to store and read them).
* when experimenting for the first times or for simulations you can set the testnet parameter to true and use your Bybit's testnt apikeys to login into the Bybit's Testnet account. 

<br>

Now we can query private endpoints like looking at our wallet balance with the command get_wallet_balance():

```python
api.account.get_wallet_balance(accountType="UNIFIED", plot=True, raw=False)
```

Like in this example, if desired this will allow us, through the corresponding parameters, to look at a pie chart of our wallet balance and have formatted response:

![](/images/wellet_distribution.png)

Total equity: $105,277.80 <br>
BTC: Wallet Balance = 1.001055, USD Value = $95510.41 <br>
ETH: Wallet Balance = 1.288068, USD Value = $4329.78 <br>
USDT: Wallet Balance = 5439.141664, USD Value = $5437.61 <br>

<br>

Another fundamental function consists in placing an order. Suppose we want to place a limit order on the BTC-USDT pair in the spot account. Based on the result we got above with the ```get_tickers()``` function we could decide to buy a quantity of 0.001 BTC when the its price reaches 96000 USDT. To place this order we simply execute:

```python
api.trade.place_order(category="linear", symbol="BTCUSDT", side="Buy", order_type="limit", qty=0.001, price="96000")
```

This should return the order id, for example:
```
'orderId: d38fcc86-c6ce-4fae-9212-f4a5d43269fhs'
```

<br>

All the functions that have been added or modified, and thus differ from the official bybit library can be found in the changes.txt file, which gives details of the modifications. Documentation for these functions is encapsulated in docstrings written within the function declarations.
