## Description

A simple tool designed to automatically generate usable types, functions, and other useful server-side code from a list of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) application to a given framework.

This is particularly helpful when working with FasttAPI backends applications and wanting to generate types and functions for the frontend.

## Currently supported frameworks

- [Nuxt3](https://nuxt.com/)

# Installation

```powershell
#  Install fast2app
pip install fast2app
```

This package is currently compatible with python 3.11 and above.

It requires that you have the [quicktype](https://quicktype.io/) CLI utility installed.

```powershell
#  Install quicktype
npm install -g quicktype
```

# Usage and examples

This package is used as a CLI tool.

```powershell
# Nuxt3
# You must ammend your nuxt.config.ts file and environement variables in order to use the new generated files. See documentations below.

fast2nuxt --fast-api-app path/to/fastapi/app.py::app_name --export-path path/to/nuxt/app/root/folder -composables

# Contributing

I've launched into this project as a side task of a bigger endeavor.

Considerig the growing popularity of [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), I think that this tool could be a great addition to the ecosystem and I have decided to make it open source.

I'm new to open source and am open to any ideas, contribution or constructive feedback.
