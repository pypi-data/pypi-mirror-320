<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck using Brujah {{ brujah }} barons.
</p>
<p>
    It relies on the defensive abilities of Anarch Barons:
    {{ organized_resistance }} for unlock and {{ bait_and_switch }} for bounces.
    Using versatile "three-way" combat cards {{ diversion }} and {{ dust_up }},
    combined with some {{ magnum }}, the deck achieves a solid defense and enough intimidation
    to get bleeds through.
</p>
<p>
    The deck builds up power while the game progresses: the Barons start to get some {{ magnum }},
    permanent intercept like {{ mr_winthrop }},
    better bleed with {{ new_carthage }} and/or {{ club_illusion }}, and blood regeneration
    with {{ papillon }} and/or {{ carfax_abbey }}.
</p>
<p>
    The list presented here uses a heavy master module supported by {{ the_parthenon }},
    with {{ ashur_tablets }} and {{ garibaldi_meucci_museum }} recursion.
    This allows the deck to run a tight 62 cards library and gives it higher chances to
    get the important unique cards.
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    Early on, {{ villein }} must be used to recoup as much blood as possible. The deck has decent defense,
    but is pool hungry. The Barons can hunt to regenerate, until {{ papillon }} and/or {{ carfax_abbey }} land.
</p>
<p>
    {{ garibaldi_meucci_museum }} is incredibly versatile, from fetching the required unlock or bounce,
    to getting the lone {{ reckless_agitation }} for damage, turn after turn if needed.
</p>
<p>
    This version aims for {{ the_slow_withering }}. The whole deck uses only inferior disciplines,
    so the card only hurts the opponents. One need to be careful when playing it, though:
    if it hurts allies more than the prey and predator it can be discarded, and fetched
    back later with {{ ashur_tablets }}. The other Gehenna cards are mostly here to allow {{ the_slow_withering }}
    to be played but can be useful in niche cases.
</p>
<p>
    {{ ashur_tablets }} can be used at mid-game to put back in deck combat and reaction cards.
    Once a first {{ ashur_tablets }} cycle has occured, the deck increases its block and combat consistency.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    Including {{ the_slow_withering }} is really specific to this one instance of the deck,
    others do not rely on events. A few cards often find their way in: {{ monkey_wrench }} for the lunge and {{
    protection_racket }}
    for intercept. Also, allies like {{ grey_thorne }}, {{ vivienne_geroux }}
    or {{ street_royals }}. Some Anarch tools like {{ open_war }} or {{ constant_revolution }} can also find a slot
    here.
    On the crypt side, {{ elen_kamjian }} often finds a spot.
</p>
<p>
    The most common variant includes rush actions to provide more flexibility, like {{ line_brawl }}.
    The {{ ashur_tablets }} recursion can also be dropped by playing a larger library.
    See for example {{ marcio_pinheiros_deck }}.
</p>
<p>
    There are a lot of variations in the combat module. If {{ dust_up }} is a constant, {{ diversion }} is sometimes
    dropped and {{ hell_for_leather }} often included.
    See for example {{ pedro_paulos_deck }}.
</p>
<p>
    The deck can also be much more rush-oriented, relying on a more brutal combat module and superior
    {{ CEL }} {{ POT }} disciplines, like in {{ erik_albenzes_deck }}.
