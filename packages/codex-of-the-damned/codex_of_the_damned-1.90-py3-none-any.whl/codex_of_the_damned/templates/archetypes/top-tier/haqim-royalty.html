<h2>Highlights</h2>
<p>
    This is a <em>toolbox</em> deck using Banu Haqim {{ banu_haqim }} Princes and Justicar.
</p>
<p>
    The deck revolves around {{ haqims_law_retribution }} to provide strong bleeds from a very heavy combat module.
    As most royalty builds, defense takes the form of {{ second_tradition_domain }} for blocks.
</p>
<p>
    The combat module is dreadful. {{ hunger_of_marduk }} coupled with additional strikes from {{ cel }},
    can consistently empty the blood from opponents vampires, and the maneuverability should guarantee the range choice
    most of the time (and avoid {{ immortal_grapple }} or aggravated {{ claws_of_the_dead }}).
</p>
<h2>Tips & Tricks</h2>
<p>
    The main weakness of the deck is its <strong>light defense</strong>. Intercept does not often go above the 2 from
    {{ second_tradition_domain }}, and this might not be enough to stop well-stealthed vote or bleed decks.
    The absence of {{ bounce }} makes bloat necessary: here {{ villein }}, {{ anathema }} and the
    excellent {{ priority_contract }}. Although unique, it will not stay in play for long if the target is chosen well
    given the heavy combat module, so it's an almost guaranteed 3 pool. It also works if the prey gets ousted
    (since their vampires leave the game), and it's a trifle!
</p>
<p>
    {{ resist_earths_grasp }} and {{ swallowed_by_the_night }} are versatile here: aside from combat, they can provide
    stealth and, in case the prey does not even try to block, they can be discarded to {{ haqims_law_retribution }}
    for additional bleed.
</p>
<p>
    {{ hunters_mark }} provide rushes that can be used anywhere for table control, but mostly as
    a countermeasure to slow down a strong predator, since {{ priority_contract }} cannot be used backwards.
</p>
<h2>Variants</h2>
<p>
    The combat module varies depending on the expected meta.
    {{ psyche }}, {{ hunger_of_marduk }} and {{ pursuit }} can be run in much more copies.
</p>
<p>
    {{ anathema }} is a tricky vote to pass, and it might require sending some voters in torpor first.
    The deck often includes {{ parity_shift }} as en easier vote to negociate,
    but given the deck's dreadful reputation it might not be that much easier and the pool gain is far lower.
</p>
<p>
    Another variant of this deck has been inaugured {{ by_karl_schaefer }} and focuses on a
    lower capacity crypt. The idea is to build more of a swarm using {{ the_embrace }} ({{ web_of_knives_recruit }} or
    {{ third_tradition_progeny }} could also be considered), and rely on a bloat with {{ consanguineous_boon }} instead
    of trying to block with {{ second_tradition_domain }} or rush backwards.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, it's worth mentioning there's a more political approach to this build, leading to quite a different
    archetype, {{ banu_politics }}.
