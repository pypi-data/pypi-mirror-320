    "system_prompt": "# Background Introduction\nYou are determining complete state transitions of a household task solving by a robot. The goal is to list all intermediate states and necessary actions in temporal order to achieve the target goals. The output consists of Boolean expressions, which are comprised of state and action primitives. Here, a state or action primitive is a first-order predicate as combinition of a predicate name and its parameters. Please note that do not use actions in your output unless necessary.In short, your task is to output the subgoal plan in the required format.\n\n# Data Vocabulary Introduction\n## Available States\nState primitive is a tuple of a predicate name and its arguments. Its formal definition looks like this \"<PredicateName>(Params)\", where <PredicateName> is the state name and each param should be ended with an id. For example, when a television is plugged in, it is represented as \"PLUGGED_IN(television.1). Another example is, if character is facing a television, it is represented as \"FACING(character.1, television.1)\". Below is a complete vocabulary of state primitives that you can and only can choose from. Note that 'obj' can represent both items and agents, while 'character' can only represent agents.\n| Predicate Name | Arguments | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| CLOSED | (obj1.id) | obj1 is closed |\n| OPEN | (obj1.id) | obj1 is open |\n| ON | (obj1.id) | obj1 is turned on, or it is activated |\n| OFF | (obj1.id) | obj1 is turned off, or it is deactivated |\n| PLUGGED_IN | (obj1.id) | obj1 is plugged in |\n| PLUGGED_OUT | (obj1.id) | obj1 is unplugged |\n| SITTING | (character1.id) | character1 is sitting, and this represents a state of a character |\n| LYING | (character1.id) | character1 is lying |\n| CLEAN | (obj1.id) | obj1 is clean |\n| DIRTY | (obj1.id) | obj1 is dirty |\n| ONTOP | (obj1.id, obj2.id) | obj1 is on top of obj2 |\n| INSIDE | (obj1.id, obj2.id) | obj1 is inside obj2 |\n| BETWEEN | (obj1.id, obj2.id, obj3.id) | obj1 is between obj2 and obj3 |\n| NEXT_TO | (obj1.id, obj2.id) | obj1 is close to or next to obj2 |\n| FACING | (character1.id, obj1.id) | character1 is facing obj1 |\n| HOLDS_RH | (character1.id, obj1.id) | character1 is holding obj1 with right hand |\n| HOLDS_LH | (character1.id, obj1.id) | character1 is holding obj1 with left hand |\n## Available Actions\nAction primitive is similar to state primitive. Its formal definition looks like this \"<ActionName>(Params)\", where <ActionName> is the action name and each param should be ended with an id. Note that, you do not need to list actions in most cases. When you choose to list actions, you should only choose from the following list of actions. For other cases, use state predicate as substitutes. Here, 'obj' only refers to items, not agents.\n| Action Name | Arguments | Argument Restriction | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| DRINK | (obj1.id) | obj1 is ['DRINKABLE', 'RECIPIENT'] | drinks obj1, need to hold obj1 first |\n| EAT | (obj1.id) | obj1 is ['EATABLE'] | eats obj1, need to hold obj1 first |\n| CUT | (obj1.id) | obj1 is ['EATABLE', 'CUTABLE'] | cuts obj1, obj1 is food|\n| TOUCH | (obj1.id) | none | touches obj1 |\n| LOOKAT | (obj1.id) | none | looks at obj1, it has a precondition that agent should be facing at obj1 first |\n| WATCH | (obj1.id) | none | watches obj1 |\n| READ | (obj1.id) | obj1 is ['READABLE'] | reads obj1, need to hold obj1 first |\n| TYPE | (obj1.id) | obj1 is ['HAS_SWITCH'] | types on obj1 |\n| PUSH | (obj1.id) | obj1 is ['MOVABLE'] | pushes obj1 |\n| PULL | (obj1.id) | obj1 is ['MOVABLE'] | pulls obj1 |\n| MOVE | (obj1.id) | obj1 is ['MOVABLE'] | moves obj1 |\n| SQUEEZE | (obj1.id) | obj1 is ['CLOTHES'] | squeezes obj1 |\n| SLEEP | none | none | sleeps, need to be at LYING or SITTING first |\n| WAKEUP | none | none | wakes up, need to be at LYING or SITTING first |\n| RINSE | (obj1.id) | none | rinses obj1, use only for cleaning appliances or teeth |\n| SCRUB | (obj1.id) | none | scrubs obj1, use only for cleaning appliances or teeth |\n| WASH | (obj1.id) | none | washes obj1, use only for appliances |\n| GRAB | (obj1.id) | obj1 is ['GRABBABLE'] | grabs obj1 |\n| SWITCHOFF | (obj1.id) | obj1 is ['HAS_SWITCH'] | switches off obj1 |\n\n# Rules You Must Follow\n- Temporal logic formula refers to a Boolean expression that describes a subgoals plan with temporal and logical order.\n- The atomic Boolean expression includes both state primitive and action primitive.\n- Boolean expressions in the same line are interchangeable with no temporal order requirement.\n- Boolean expresssions in different lines are in temporal order, where the first one should be satisfied before the second one.\n- Boolean expression can be combined with the following logical operators: \"and\", \"or\".\n- The \"and\" operator combines Boolean expressions that are interchangeable but needs to be satisfied simultaneously in the end.\n- The \"or\" operator combines Boolean expressions that are interchangeable but only one of them needs to be satisfied in the end.\n- When there is temporal order requirement, output the Boolean expressions in different lines.\n- Add intermediate states if necessary to improve logical consistency.\n- If you want to change state of A, while A is in B and B is closed, you should make sure B is open first.\n- Your output format should strictly follow this json format: {\"necessity_to_use_action\": <necessity>, \"actions_to_include\": [<actions>], \"output\": [<your subgoal plan>]}, where in <necessity> you should put \"yes\" or \"no\" to indicate whether actions should be included in subgoal plans. If you believe it is necessary to use actions, in the field <actions>, you should list all actions you used in your output. Otherwise, you should simply output an empty list []. In the field <your subgoal plan>, you should list all Boolean expressions in the required format and the temporal order.\n\nBelow are two examples for your better understanding.\n## Example 1: Task category is \"Listen to music\"\n## Relevant Objects in the Scene\n| obj | category | properties |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| bathroom.1 | Rooms | [] |\n| character.65 | Characters | [] |\n| home_office.319 | Rooms | [] |\n| couch.352 | Furniture | ['LIEABLE', 'MOVABLE', 'SITTABLE', 'SURFACES'] |     \n| television.410 | Electronics | ['HAS_PLUG', 'HAS_SWITCH', 'LOOKABLE'] |      \n| dvd_player.1000 | placable_objects | ['CAN_OPEN', 'GRABBABLE', 'HAS_PLUG', 'HAS_SWITCH', 'MOVABLE', 'SURFACES'] |\n\n## Initial States\nCLEAN(dvd_player.1000)\nCLOSED(dvd_player.1000)\nOFF(dvd_player.1000)\nPLUGGED_IN(dvd_player.1000)\nINSIDE(character.65, bathroom.1)\n\n## Goal States\n[States]\nCLOSED(dvd_player.1000)\nON(dvd_player.1000)\nPLUGGED_IN(dvd_player.1000)\n[Actions Must Include]: Actions are listed in the execution order, each line is one action to satisfy.
