    """
    Can be used to 3D watershed a binary image. Watershedding attempts to use an algorithm to split touching objects into seperate labelled components. Labelled output will be saved to the active directory if none is specified.
    This watershed algo essentially uses the distance transform to decide where peaks are and then after thresholding out the non-peaks, uses the peaks as labelling kernels for a smart label. It runs semi slow without GPU accel since it requires two dts to be computed.
    :param image: (Mandatory, string or ndarray). - If string, a path to a binary .tif to watershed, or an ndarray containing the same.
    :param directory: (Optional - Val = None; string) - A filepath to save outputs.
    :param proportion: (Optional - Val = 0.1; float) - A zero to one value representing the proportion of watershed 'peaks' that are kept around for splitting objects. Essentially,
    making this value smaller makes the watershed break more things, however making it too small will result in some unusual failures where small objects all get the same label. 
    :param GPU: (Optional - Val = True; boolean). If True, GPU will be used to watershed. Please note this will result in internal downsampling most likely, and overall be very fast.
    However, this downsampling may kick small nodes out of the image. Do not use the GPU to watershed if your GPU wants to downsample beyond the size of the smallest node that you
    want to keep in the output. Set to False to use the CPU (no downsampling). Note using the GPU + downsample may take around a minute to process arrays that are a few GB while the CPU may take an hour or so.
    :param smallest_rad: (Optional - Val = None; int). The size (in voxels) of the radius of the smallest object you want to seperate with watershedding. Note that the
    'proportion' param is the affector of watershed outputs but itself may be confusing to tinker with. By inputting a smallest_rad, the algo will instead compute a custom proportion
    to use for your data.

If unset, only directly overlapping nodes and edges will find connections.
        :param diledge: (Optional - Val = None; int). Amount to dilate edges, to account for imaging and segmentation artifacts that have brokenup edges. Any edge masks that are within half the value of the 'diledge' param will become connected. Ideally edges should not have gaps,
        so some amount of dilation is recommended if there are any, but not so much to create overconnectivity. This is a value that needs to be tuned by the user.
        :param inners: (Optional - Val = True; boolean). Will use inner edges if True, will not if False. Inner edges are parts of the edge mask that exist within search regions. If search regions overlap, 
        any edges that exist within the overlap will only assert connectivity if 'inners' is True.
        :param hash_inners: (Optional - Val = True; boolean). If False, all search regions that contain an edge object connecting multiple nodes will be assigned as connected.
        If True, an extra processing step is used to sort the correct connectivity amongst these search_regions. Can only be computed when search_regions property is set.
        :param remove_trunk: (Optional - Val = 0; int). Amount of times to remove the 'Trunk' from the edges. A trunk in this case is the largest (by vol) edge object remaining after nodes have broken up the edges.
        Any 'Trunks' removed will be absent for connection calculations.
        :param ignore_search_region: (Optional - Val = False; boolean). If False, will use primary algorithm (with search_regions property) to find connections. If True, will use secondary algorithm (with nodes) to find connections.
        :param other_nodes: (Optional - Val = None; string). Path to either a tif file or a directory containing only additional node files to merge with the original nodes, assuming multiple 'types' of nodes need comparing. Node identities will be retained.
        :param label_nodes: (Optional - Val = True; boolean). If True, all discrete objects in the node param (and all those contained in the optional other_nodes param) will be assigned a label. If files a prelabelled, set this to False to avoid labelling.
        :param directory: (Optional - Val = None; string). Path to a directory to save to hard mem all Network_3D properties. If not set, these values will be saved to the active directory.
        :param GPU: (Optional - Val = True; boolean). Will use GPU if avaialble for calculating the search_region step (including necessary downsampling for GPU RAM). Set to False to use CPU with no downsample. Note this only affects the search_region step.
        :param fast_dil: (Optional - Val = False, boolean) - A boolean that when True will utilize faster cube dilation but when false will use slower spheroid dilation.
        :param skeletonize: (Optional - Val = False, boolean) - A boolean of whether to skeletonize the edges when using them.

        Generates a random network of equivalent edge and node count to the current Network_3D object. This may be useful, for example, in comparing aspects of the Network_3D object
        to a similar random network, to demonstrate whether the Network_3D object is a result that itself can be considered random. For example, we can find the modularity of the
        random network and compare it to the Network_3D object's modularity. Note that the random result will itself not have a consistent modularity score between instances this
        method is called, due to randomness, in which case iterating over a large number, say 100, of these random networks will give a tighter comparison point. Please note that
        since Network_3D objects are weighted for multiple connections by default, the random network will consider each additional weight as an additional edge. So a network that has
        one edge of weight one and one of weight two will cause the random network to incorperate 3 edges (that may be crunched into one weighted edge themselves). Please call remove_edge_weights()
        on the Network_3D() object prior to generating the random network if this behavior is not desired.
        :param weighted: (Optional - Val = True; boolean). By default (when True), the random network will be able to take on edge weights by assigning additional edge

        the random network, there is a scenario where no new connections can be found and this method will become caught in a while loop.
