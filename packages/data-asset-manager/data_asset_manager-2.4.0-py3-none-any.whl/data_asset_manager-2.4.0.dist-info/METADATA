# Data Asset Manager
### data-asset-manager
Data comes in all shapes and sizes. Data Asset Manger does all the heavy lifting when it comes to simple management 
tasks in Pandas. Once a Blob object is instantiated, using a simple dictionary of configuration settings, tasks like 
reading/writing, sorting and deduplicating, can all be performed with a basic command.
Version 2 added the ability to read files in chunks, reducing the memory overhead for the enormous files we're expected 
to handle these days, and version 3 will start to introduce more complex tasks, such as name and address enhancement.
