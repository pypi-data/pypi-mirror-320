Users communicate with the bot as with a regular contact, and the bot responds depending on its settings and logic.",

Think of the API as a menu in a restaurant: you select a dish (function or data) and the kitchen (another program) prepares it and serves it to you. You don't see the cooking process, but you know exactly what you will get in the end. An API works the same way, giving one program the ability to use the functions of another program without having to delve into its internal processes.",

Telegram bots also have an account, but it is created through BotFather, and access is provided through a token. A token is a unique key that confirms the right to use the API and is transmitted with each request to the server. Like a personal password, the token must be protected.",
