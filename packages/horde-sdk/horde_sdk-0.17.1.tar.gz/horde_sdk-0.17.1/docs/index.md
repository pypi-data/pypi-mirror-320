horde_sdk is in beta. Everything is subject to change. Please feel free to report bugs or make suggestions on our <a href="https://github.com/Haidra-Org/horde-sdk">github issue page</a>

This library simplifies interfacing with any API created by [Haidra](https://github.com/Haidra-Org) - the community organization
behind the free projects such as AI-Horde ([homepage](https://aihorde.net/), [github](https://github.com/db0/AI-Horde)).
The goal is to minimize the amount of time it takes to develop applications in python that use our free, volunteer driven, services which include:

- Stable Diffusion Image Generation (driven by [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI))
- Image captioning
- Image rating (currently ratings are for [diffusiondb](https://poloclub.github.io/diffusiondb/), others coming in the future)
- Text Generation using LLMs (driven by [KoboldAI](https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client))

From anything to requesting your own images, or rolling your own [worker](https://github.com/Haidra-Org/AI-Horde-Worker) software, this package may suit your needs.

See the navigation bar on the right. If you're looking for the code reference, (sub)package names are in monospace font.
