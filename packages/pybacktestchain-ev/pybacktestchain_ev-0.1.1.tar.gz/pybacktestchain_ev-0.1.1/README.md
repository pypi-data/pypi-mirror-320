# pybacktestchain-ev

Package for the Python Course based on pybacktestchain library by J. Imbett.

## Overview

`pybacktestchain-ev` is a Python package designed to facilitate portfolio backtesting using various trading strategies. The package incorporates risk management tools, blockchain-based backtest storage, and a user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.

## Installation

You can install the package via pip:

```bash
$ pip install pybacktestchain-ev
```

## Features

- **Interactive UI**: A Streamlit-based interactive interface for configuring backtests, visualizing results, analyzing performance and risk metrics.
- **Portfolio Backtesting**: Supports backtesting of standard trading strategies such as Equal Weight, Minimum Variance, Maximum Sharpe Ratio, and Risk Parity.
- **Customizable Transaction Costs**: Allows precise configuration of trading fees for realistic simulations.
- **Risk Management**: Includes stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms with customizable thresholds, as well as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall for the backtested portfolio.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Stores backtest results in a blockchain.

## Usage

### Running the Streamlit Interface

To start the Streamlit interface:

```bash
$ streamlit run <your_app_file>.py
```

### Configuring a Backtest

1. **Select Tickers**: Enter stock tickers (comma-separated) to define the universe (works across all asset classes).
2. **Set Parameters**:
   - Initial cash amount.
   - Start and end dates for the backtest.
   - Choose a strategy: Equal Weight, Minimum Variance, Maximum Sharpe Ratio, or Risk Parity.
   - Configure risk management: Stop-loss, take-profit percentages, and transaction costs.
3. **Run the Backtest**: Click the "Run Backtest" button.

### Viewing Results

- Portfolio value and returns are displayed over time, as well as the distribution of returns.
- Risk metrics, such as Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES), are calculated.
- A transaction log is provided for detailed insights and store to the blockchain.
- Additional visualizations include correlation heatmaps and return distributions.

### Blockchain Storage

Each backtest is saved in a blockchain under a randomly generated name. This ensures results are tamper-proof and can be referenced later. Blockchain files are stored in the `blockchain/` directory within the package folder.
