# python-can-coe

This module provides a CAN bus interface allowing to use [CoE (CAN over Ethernet)](https://wiki.ta.co.at/CAN_over_Ethernet_(CoE)) with [python-can](https://pypi.org/project/python-can/).

Its intended use is for communicating with the CMI module from [Technische Alternative](https://help.ta.co.at/DE/CMIHELP/coe____can_over_ethernet_.htm).

The interface allows sending and receiving CAN datagrams over UDP and convert them into easy to use message objects. 

## Using python-can-coe

There are two different versions of CoE from Technische Alternaive.

Examples how to use `python-can-coe` with both versions are in the [`examples`](https://c0d3.sh/smarthome/python-can-coe/src/branch/main/examples) directory,
