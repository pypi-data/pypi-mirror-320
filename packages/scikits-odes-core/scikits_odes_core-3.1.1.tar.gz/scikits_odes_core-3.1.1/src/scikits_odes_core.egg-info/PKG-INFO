This package contains the core support classes for ODES.
`pip install scikits-odes` to get all the available solvers.


ODES is a scikit for Python 3.7+ offering extra ode/dae solvers, as an extension
to what is available in scipy.
The documentation is available at [Read The
Docs](https://scikits-odes.readthedocs.io/), and API docs can be found at
https://bmcage.github.io/odes.

# Available solvers:
ODES provides interfaces to the following solvers:
* BDF linear multistep method for stiff problems (CVODE and IDA from SUNDIALS)
* Adams-Moulton linear multistep method for nonstiff problems (CVODE and IDA
  from SUNDIALS)
* Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order (4)5 with stepsize control (*dopri5*
  from `scipy.integrate`)
* Explicit Runge-Kutta method of order 8(5,3) with stepsize control (*dop853*
  from `scipy.integrate`)
* Historical solvers: *lsodi* and *ddaspk* are available for comparison reasons.
  Use IDA instead! Note that *lsodi* fails on architecture *aarch64*.


# Usage
A simple example solving the Van der Pol oscillator is as follows:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from scikits_odes import ode

t0, y0 = 1, np.array([0.5, 0.5])  # initial condition
def van_der_pol(t, y, ydot):
    """ we create rhs equations for the problem"""
    ydot[0] = y[1]
    ydot[1] = 1000*(1.0-y[0]**2)*y[1]-y[0]

solution = ode('cvode', van_der_pol, old_api=False).solve(np.linspace(t0,500,200), y0)
plt.plot(solution.values.t, solution.values.y[:,0], label='Van der Pol oscillator')
plt.show()
```

For simplicity there is also a convenience function `odeint` wrapping the ode
solver class. See the [User Guide](https://scikits-odes.readthedocs.io/) for a
simple example for `odeint`, as well as simple examples for object orientated
interfaces and further examples using ODES solvers.


# Projects that use odes
You can learn by example from following code that uses ODES:
* Centrifuge simulation, a wrapper around the ida solver: see
  [centrifuge-1d](https://github.com/bmcage/centrifuge-1d/blob/master/centrifuge1d/modules/shared/solver.py)

You have a project using odes? Do a pull request to add your project.

# Citing ODES
If you use ODES as part of your research, can you please cite the
[ODES JOSS paper](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.00165). Additionally, if you use
one of the SUNDIALS solvers, we strongly encourage you to cite the
[SUNDIALS papers](https://computation.llnl.gov/projects/sundials/publications).
