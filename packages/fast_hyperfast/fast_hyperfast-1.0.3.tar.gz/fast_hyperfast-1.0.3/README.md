# Fast HyperFast âš¡

Fast Hyperfast is a project heavily inspired by the ideas and (some) of the code from [HyperFast](https://github.com/AI-sandbox/HyperFast). The project aims to improve it adding the possibility to:

  - Save the main model result inside a pkl file (so you can import it on your embedded device, raspberry pi, etc.)
  - Add the code for training the HyperNetwork 
  - Re-write the code so you have two sources to look at the same stuff (and it was a great experience for learning how it works!)
