## Why Fixpoint?

Normally, to get the right company and people data, you need to buy and combine
datasets from dozens of providers, bolt on custom web-scraping code, and review
data quality manually.

Instead, you can integrate Fixpoint's API and get all of the above.

## Examples

Some examples:

- [Using AI to crawl a website and extract structured data](https://docs.fixpoint.co/examples/extract-crawl)
- [Parse a website (or web crawl) into LLM-ready text](https://docs.fixpoint.co/examples/parse-site)


## Getting started

Fixpoint is a Python package. First, install it:

```bash
pip install fixpoint
```

```python
from fixpoint.client import FixpointClient
from fixpoint.client.types import CreateRecordExtractionRequest, CrawlUrlSource

client = FixpointClient(api_key="...")

extraction = client.extractions.record.create(
    CreateRecordExtractionRequest(
        workflow_id="my-workflow-id",
        source=CrawlUrlSource(crawl_url="https://fixpoint.co", depth=2, page_limit=3),
        questions=[
            "What is the product summary?",
            "What are the industries the business serves?",
            "What are the use-cases of the product?",
            "According to the privacy policy, what data is collected from users?",
        ],
    )
)

print(extraction.model_dump_json(indent=2))
```
