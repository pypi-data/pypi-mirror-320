End-User License Agreement (EULA) for ReadStore Basic 30 Days Free Trial Demo Version 


“Software” refers to the ReadStore Basic program provided by EVOBYTE Digital Biology, Dr. Jonathan Alles (“Provider”). It includes all components, executable code, libraries as well as future patches and updates. Related software components such as the ReadStore Command Line Interface (ReadStore CLI) or Software Development Kits (ReadStore SDKs), which are licensed under an Open Source License, are not part of this agreement.

This End User License Agreement (“Agreement”) is made between EVOBYTE Digital Biology Dr. Jonathan Alles (“Provider”), and you, the user of the software (hereinafter referred to as “End User”). By downloading, installing, using the software or requesting a license key you agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.

Section 1 - License Grant

This Agreement grants End User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable license to install and use the Software solely for evaluation purposes for a period of 30 days.

End User’s rights under this Agreement are non-exclusive and non-assignable. Unless otherwise agreed, the Software will be delivered electronically and is considered fully delivered and accepted upon download by End User.

The Software is licensed, not sold. To continue using the Software after the trial period, End User may purchase a commercial license, which requires a separate agreement with the Provider.

A valid license key is required to use the Software. Accessing or using the Software without a valid license key is prohibited and may result in termination of this license.

Section 2 - License Activation

This software is available for download through a public package manager. However, a valid license key EVOBYTE Digital Biology Jonathan Alles (Provider) is required to activate and use it legally. 

Downloading or installing the software alone does not grant usage rights. Users must request a license key from the Provider to activate the software and access all features. Unauthorized use without a valid license key is a violation of these terms and may result in license termination.

Section 3 - Permitted Uses

The End User is permitted to use the software for evaluation purposes. The End User agrees not to use the software for any purpose other than as expressly permitted by this Agreement.

Section 4 - Restrictions and Prohibited Uses

The End User may not alter, merge, modify, adapt, translate, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or otherwise reduce the Software to a human-perceivable form.

The End User may not rent, lease, or sublicense the Software.

The End User may not create derivative works based upon the Software.

The End User may not remove, alter or obscure any copyright or other proprietary notices, labels or marks from the Software.

The End User may not otherwise install, access or otherwise use or copy the Software other than in strict compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

Section 5 - Ownership and Intellectual Property Rights

All rights, title, and interest in the Software, including its source code, object code, design, features, functionality, graphics, trademarks, logos, and all other elements, are the exclusive property of the Provider.

Section 6 - Trial Period

The trial period starts once the trial license key is sent to the End User by email or other electronic means and lasts for 30 days. The trial ends automatically, without any charges for the End User.
During the trial, the End User may extend access by purchasing a commercial license. The End User also has the right to cancel the trial at any time by notifying the Provider via email at license@evo-byte.com. Upon cancellation, the End User will lose access to all data stored or generated with the Software.

At the end of the trial period, access to all stored or generated data will be discontinued. It is the End User's responsibility to back up any data they wish to keep before the trial ends. Access can be restored by purchasing a commercial license, which involves a separate agreement between the End User and the Provider.

Section 7 - Termination

Certain features and access to data uploaded to the Software will be disabled at the end of the trial period and “the Provider” will have no liability to the End User.
The Provider may terminate this Agreement and revoke access to the Software at any time, without notice, if the End User breaches any terms of this Agreement, including unauthorized use or misuse of the Software.

Section 8 - User Data and User Responsibility

The End User owns all rights, title, and interest in the data uploaded or input into the Software, as well as the End User's confidential information.

The End User is responsible for securely storing passwords, database files, backups, and other secrets associated with the Software. The End User must follow the installation procedures described in the accompanying software manual and/or README file, in particular regarding changing and storing passwords and keys as described.

The End User must ensure secure storage and management of any database files created, used, or stored with the Software. This includes taking appropriate measures to protect data against loss, unauthorized access, or corruption. Setting up a secure directory for backups is also the End User's responsibility.

Section 9 - Updates and Modifications to Terms

The Provider reserves the right to modify or update these Terms of Use at any time. The End User will be notified of material changes through:
Email Notification: A notice will be sent to the email address provided by the End User.

Changes are effective immediately unless otherwise specified. Continued use of the Software after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms. If the End User disagrees with the updated Terms, they must stop using the Software and notify the Provider to terminate their trial or license.

Section 10 - Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability

The Software is provided "as is" and "as available," without any warranties, express or implied. The Provider makes no guarantees regarding performance, reliability, completeness, or suitability for any particular purpose.

The Provider is not liable for any damages, losses, or expenses (including direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages), or any data loss or corruption resulting from use or inability to use the Software during the trial period.

Section 11 - Indemnification

The End User agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Provider from all claims, damages, 
liabilities, losses, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees) arising from:
Violation of Agreement: Any breach of this Agreement by the End User, including unauthorized use of the Software.

Misuse of Software: Any improper or illegal use of the Software, including actions that violate third-party rights or laws.

User Data: Claims resulting from data uploaded, inputted, or processed by the End User, including issues with accuracy, legality, or storage.

Section 12 - Governing Law and Jurisdiction

These Terms of Use are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany. Any disputes arising from or related to these Terms of Use, the software, or the trial period shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of courts in Mainz, Germany.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
