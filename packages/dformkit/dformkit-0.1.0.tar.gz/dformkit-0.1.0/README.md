# DFormKit

**DFormKit** is a Python library designed to help Django developers **dynamically generate forms**, manage views, and streamline template creation based on Django models.

## 🦸 Quick Start

Getting started with **DFormKit** is a piece of cake! Just use the following command style:

```bash
python manage.py dformkit myapp Person
```

**Note:**

- Replace `myapp` with your Django app name.
- Replace `Person` with your model name.

If you don’t specify additional options, it’ll generate a dynamic form for the model and save it in `forms.py`. Easy-peasy!

## 🧰 Additional Features

### Using Named Arguments

You can use named arguments for more flexibility. For example:

```bash
python manage.py dformkit -app=myapp -model=Person -view
```

or

```bash
python manage.py dformkit -app=myapp -model=Person --pv
```

- **What it does:** Works the same as positional arguments but provides a more explicit way to specify the app and model.

### Customizing Templates

The generated templates are fully customizable. You can integrate styling frameworks like **Tailwind CSS** or **Bootstrap** by modifying the generated HTML files.
