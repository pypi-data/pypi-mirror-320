## üß∞ Additional Features

### Using Named Arguments

You can use named arguments for more flexibility. For example:

```bash
python manage.py dformkit -app=myapp -model=Person -view
```

or

```bash
python manage.py dformkit -app=myapp -model=Person --pv
```

- **What it does:** Works the same as positional arguments but provides a more explicit way to specify the app and model.
