```

## Quick Start

To start building your own agent, follow the steps listed.

1. set environmental variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`

    ```
    # .env
    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
    ```

2. bring in SDKs from `CEO`

    - `Agent` lets you instantiate an agent.

    - `Personality` is an enumeration class used for customizing personalities of agents.

        - `Personality.PRUDENT` makes the agent's behavior more cautious.

        - `Personality.INQUISITIVE` encourages the agent to be more proactive in trying and exploring.

    - `get_openai_model` gives you a `BaseChatModel` as thought engine.

    - `@ability(brain: BaseChatModel, cache: bool = True, cache_dir: str = '')` is a decorator which lets you declare a function as an `Ability`.

    - `@agentic(agent: Agent)` is a decorator which lets you declare a function as an `AgenticAbility`.

    ```python
    from ceo import (
        Agent,
        Personality,
        get_openai_model,
        ability,
        agentic
    )
    ```

3. declare functions as basic abilities

    ```python
    @ability
    def calculator(expr: str) -> float:
        # this function only accepts a single math expression
        return simplify(expr)

    @ability
    def write_file(filename: str, content: str) -> str:
        with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
            f.write(content)
        return f'{content} written to {filename}.'
    ```

4. instantiate an agent

    You can grant abilities to agents while instantiating them.

    ```python
    model = get_openai_model()
    agent = Agent(abilities=[calculator, write_file], brain=model, name='CEO', personality=Personality.INQUISITIVE)
    ```

    - You can also grant more abilities to agents later:

        ```python
        agent.grant_ability(calculator)
        ```

        or

        ```python
        agent.grant_abilities([calculator])
        ```

    - To deprive abilities:

        ```python
        agent.deprive_ability(calculator)
        ```

        or

        ```python
        agent.deprive_abilities([calculator])
        ```
    
    You can change an agent's personality using method `change_personality(personality: Personality)`

    ```python
    agent.change_personality(Personality.PRUDENT)
    ```

5. assign a request to your agent

    ```python
    agent.assign("Here is a sphere with radius of (1 * 9.5 / 2 * 2) cm and pi here is 3.14159, find the area and volume respectively then write the results into a file called 'result.txt'.")
    ```

6. leave the rest to your agent

    ```python
    response = agent.just_do_it()
    print(response)
    ```

> `ceo` also supports multi-agent collaboration scenario, declare a function as agent calling ability with `@agentic(agent: Agent)`, then grant it to an agent. [See example](#multi-agent).


## Examples

- ### Compound Tasks

    1. Find the surface area and volume of a sphere and write the results into a file.

- ### Multi-agent
    
    1. Ask the suitable agents to find the surface area and volume of a sphere and write the results into a file.
  
        ```python
        import logging

        from sympy import simplify

            get_openai_model,
            agentic,
            ability
        )

        load_dotenv()
        logging.getLogger('ceo').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

            # this function only accepts a single math expression
            return simplify(expr)


        @ability
        def write_file(filename: str, content: str) -> str:
            with open(filename, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                f.write(content)
            return f'{content} written to {filename}.'


        jack = Agent(abilities=[calculator], brain=model, name='Jack', personality=Personality.INQUISITIVE)
        tylor = Agent(abilities=[write_file], brain=model, name='Tylor', personality=Personality.PRUDENT)


        @agentic(jack)
        def agent1():

            print(result)
        ```

        > In multi-agent collaboration scenario, you can assign different personalities to each distinct agent. For example, in the aforementioned script, Jack's capability is to perform calculations. I want him to try more and explore more, so Jack's personality is set to `Personality.INQUISITIVE`. On the other hand, Taylor's capability is to create and write files. For operations involving interaction with the external file system, I want him to be more cautious, so Taylor's personality is set to `Personality.PRUDENT`.
