## Quick Start

To get started with **edg4llm**, follow the steps below. This example demonstrates how to use the library to generate dialogue data based on a specific prompt.

### Prerequisites

1. Install the **edg4llm** package:
```bash
   pip install edg4llm
```

2. Ensure you have Python version 3.8 or higher.

3. Obtain the necessary API key and base URL for your chosen model provider (e.g., ChatGLM).

### Code Example(Chinese Version)
```python
# chatglm_demo.py

import edg4llm
print(edg4llm.__version__)

from edg4llm import EDG4LLM

api_key = "xxx"
base_url = "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4/chat/completions"

edg = EDG4LLM(model_provider='chatglm', model_name="glm-4-flash", base_url=base_url, api_key=api_key)
# 设置测试数据
system_prompt = """你是一个精通中国古代诗词的古文学大师"""

user_prompt = """
    目标: 1. 请生成过年为场景的连续多轮对话记录
            2. 提出的问题要多样化。
            3. 要符合人类的说话习惯。
            4. 严格遵循规则: 请以如下格式返回生成的数据, 只返回JSON格式，json模板:  
                [
                    {{
                        "input":"AAA","output":"BBB" 
                    }}
                ]
                其中input字段表示一个人的话语, output字段表示专家的话语
"""
num_samples = 1  # 只生成一个对话样本

# 调用 generate 方法生成对话
data_dialogue = edg.generate(
    task_type="dialogue",
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
    user_prompt=user_prompt,
    num_samples=num_samples
)
```
### Code Example(English Version)
```python
# chatglm_demo.py

import edg4llm
print(edg4llm.__version__)

from edg4llm import EDG4LLM

api_key = "xxx"
base_url = "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/paas/v4/chat/completions"

edg = EDG4LLM(model_provider='chatglm', model_name="glm-4-flash", base_url=base_url, api_key=api_key)

# Set the test data
system_prompt = """You are a master of ancient Chinese literature, specializing in classical poetry."""

user_prompt = """
    Goal: 1. Please generate a multi-turn dialogue set in the context of celebrating the Lunar New Year.
          2. The questions should be diverse.
          3. The dialogue should align with natural human conversational habits.
          4. Strictly follow this rule: Please return the generated data in the following format, only in JSON format. JSON template:  
                [
                    {{
                        "input":"AAA","output":"BBB" 
                    }}
                ]
                Where the input field represents a person's dialogue, and the output field represents the expert's response.
"""
num_samples = 1  # Generate only one dialogue sample

# Call the generate method to generate the dialogue
data_dialogue = edg.generate(
    task_type="dialogue",
    system_prompt=system_prompt,
    user_prompt=user_prompt,
    num_samples=num_samples
)

```

### Explanation

1. Importing the Library: Import the edg4llm library and verify the version using print(edg4llm.__version__).

2. Initialization: Use EDG4LLM to initialize the library with the appropriate model provider, model name, base URL, and API key.

3. Prompts:
    - system_prompt defines the behavior or role of the assistant.
    - user_prompt provides specific instructions for generating data.
4. Data Generation:
Use the generate method with the following parameters:
    - task_type: Defines the type of task (e.g., dialogue, question-answering).
    - system_prompt and user_prompt: Provide context and task-specific instructions.
    - num_samples: Specifies how many samples to generate.
5. Output: The generated data is returned as a JSON object in the specified format.

## Requirements
This project has **minimal dependencies**, requiring only the requests library. Make sure to have the following version installed:

- requests>=2.32.3

## Future Development Plans
1. - [ ] Recording Introduction Video
2. - [ ] Support Gemini2
3. - [ ] Support local large language models
4. - [ ] Support other types of data, such as picture.
