class Endpoint(RunnerAbstraction):
    """
    Decorator which allows you to create a web endpoint out of the decorated function.
    Tasks are invoked synchronously as HTTP requests.

    Parameters:
        cpu (Union[int, float, str]):
            The number of CPU cores allocated to the container. Default is 1.0.
        memory (Union[int, str]):
            The amount of memory allocated to the container. It should be specified in
            MiB, or as a string with units (e.g. "1Gi"). Default is 128 MiB.
        gpu (Union[GpuTypeAlias, List[GpuTypeAlias]]):
            The type or name of the GPU device to be used for GPU-accelerated tasks. If not
            applicable or no GPU required, leave it empty.
            You can specify multiple GPUs by providing a list of GpuTypeAlias. If you specify several GPUs,
            the scheduler prioritizes their selection based on their order in the list.
        gpu_count (int):
            The number of GPUs allocated to the container. Default is 0. If a GPU is
            specified but this value is set to 0, it will be automatically updated to 1.
        image (Union[Image, dict]):
            The container image used for the task execution. Default is [Image](#image).
        volumes (Optional[List[Volume]]):
            A list of volumes to be mounted to the endpoint. Default is None.
        timeout (Optional[int]):
            The maximum number of seconds a task can run before it times out.
            Default is 3600. Set it to -1 to disable the timeout.
        retries (Optional[int]):
            The maximum number of times a task will be retried if the container crashes. Default is 3.
        workers (Optional[int]):
            The number of processes handling tasks per container.
            Modifying this parameter can improve throughput for certain workloads.
            Workers will share the CPU, Memory, and GPU defined.
            You may need to increase these values to increase concurrency.
            Default is 1.
        keep_warm_seconds (int):
            The duration in seconds to keep the task queue warm even if there are no pending
            tasks. Keeping the queue warm helps to reduce the latency when new tasks arrive.
            Default is 10s.
        max_pending_tasks (int):
            The maximum number of tasks that can be pending in the queue. If the number of
            pending tasks exceeds this value, the task queue will stop accepting new tasks.
            Default is 100.
        secrets (Optional[List[str]):
            A list of secrets that are injected into the container as environment variables. Default is [].
        name (Optional[str]):
            An optional name for this endpoint, used during deployment. If not specified, you must specify the name
            at deploy time with the --name argument
        authorized (bool):
            If false, allows the endpoint to be invoked without an auth token.
            Default is True.
        autoscaler (Optional[Autoscaler]):
            Configure a deployment autoscaler - if specified, you can use scale your function horizontally using
            various autoscaling strategies (Defaults to QueueDepthAutoscaler())
        callback_url (Optional[str]):
            An optional URL to send a callback to when a task is completed, timed out, or cancelled.
        task_policy (TaskPolicy):
            The task policy for the function. This helps manage the lifecycle of an individual task.
            Setting values here will override timeout and retries.
        checkpoint_enabled (bool):
            (experimental) Whether to enable checkpointing for the endpoint. Default is False.
            If enabled, the app will be checkpointed after the on_start function has completed.
            On next invocation, each container will restore from a checkpoint and resume execution instead of
            booting up from cold.
    Example:
        ```python
