Pointblank is a table validation and testing library for Python. It helps you ensure that your tabular data meets certain expectations and constraints and it presents the results in a beautiful (and useful!) validation table.

## Getting Started

Let's take a Polars DataFrame and validate it against a set of constraints. We do that by using the `pb.Validate` class and then adding validation steps:

```python
import pointblank as pb

validation = (
    pb.Validate(data=pb.load_dataset(dataset="small_table")) # Use Validate() to start
    .col_vals_gt(columns="d", value=100)       # STEP 1 |
    .col_vals_le(columns="c", value=5)         # STEP 2 | <-- Build up a validation plan
    .col_exists(columns=["date", "date_time"]) # STEP 3 |
    .interrogate() # This will execute all validation steps and collect intel
)

validation
```

The rows in the validation table correspond to each of the validation steps. One of the key concepts is that validation steps can be broken down into atomic test cases (test units) and each of these test units is given either of pass/fail status based on the validation constraints. You'll see these tallied up in the reporting table (in the `UNITS`, `PASS`, and `FAIL` columns).

Tabular reporting is just one way to see the results. You can also obtain fine-grained results of the interrogation as JSON output or through methods that get key metrics. You can also utilize the validation results to perform filtering of the input table based on row-level pass/fail status (via the `get_sundered_data()` method).

On the input side, we can use the following types of tables:

- Polars DataFrame
- Pandas DataFrame
- DuckDB table
- MySQL table
- PostgreSQL table
- SQLite table
- Parquet

To make this all work seamlessly, we use [Narwhals](https://github.com/narwhals-dev/narwhals) to work with Polars and Pandas DataFrames. We also integrate with [Ibis](https://github.com/ibis-project/ibis) to enable the use of DuckDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Parquet. In doing all of this, we can provide an ergonomic and consistent API for validating tabular data from various sources.

## Features

Here's a short list of what we think makes pointblank a great tool for data validation:

- **Declarative Syntax**: Define your data validation rules simply, using a declarative syntax
- **Flexible**: We support tables from Polars, Pandas, Duckdb, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Parquet
- **Beautiful Reports**: Generate beautiful HTML table reports on how the data validation went down
- **Functional Output**: Extract the specific data validation outputs you need for further processing
- **Data Testing**: Write tests for your data and use them in your notebooks or testing framework
- **Easy to Use**: Get started quickly with a simple API and super clear documentation
- **Powerful**: You can develop complex data validation rules with flexible options for customization

## Installation

You can install pointblank using pip:

```bash
pip install pointblank
```
