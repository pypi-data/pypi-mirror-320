    Detect the evoked responses in CCEP data (a matrix of multiple electrodes and stimulation-pairs)

    Args:
        data (ndarray):                     A three-dimensional array with the average signal per electrode and
                                            stimulus-pair (representing: electrodes x stimulation-pairs x time).
        stim_onset_index (int):             the time-point on the input data's time-dimension of stimulation onset (as a
                                            0-based sample-index, all indices before this value are considered pre-stim)
        sampling_rate (int or double):      The sampling rate at which the data was acquired
        evaluation_callback (callback):     Callback for metric evaluation; None to detect using standard baseline;
        detect_positive (bool):             Whether to search for positive rather than negative evoked responses


    Returns:
        tuple:                              A tuple containing two ndarrays. Both arrays will be two-dimensional
                                            (representing: electrodes x stimulation-pairs) and match the first two
                                            dimensions of the input. The first ndarray contains the (sample) indices of
                                            the evoked responses; The second ndarray contains the amplitudes of the
                                            evokes responses.
