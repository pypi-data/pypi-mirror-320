This is just a sample package.

Use `pip install some-ascii-arts` to install this package.

Enter `asciiart [art-type]` to draw the ASCII art. Select `art-type` from `b`, `c`, or `m` for `banana`, `chocolate`, or `moon`, respectively.

I obtained the ASCII art from [this site](https://www.asciiart.eu)
