    '''units manager with the from_bifrost method,
    which determines all units based on only u_l, u_t, and u_r.

    Note: cgs units for electromagnetic quantities are not supported here,
        because cgs electromagnetic equations differ from SI equations,
        e.g. cgs includes extra factors of 4*pi or c in various places.

    How to infer electromagnetic units from t, l, and r alone?
        It is possible because 'raw' Bifrost units guarantee mu0 = 1,
            while in 'si', mu0 = 4 * pi * 10^-7 Newtons Ampere^-2
        Internally, this method determines:
            u_M = u_r * u_l**3   # mass
            u_N = u_M * u_l * u_t**-2   # energy (Newtons in SI)
        Amperes units:
            (mu0 [si]) = u_N * u_A**-2 * (mu0 [raw])
            --> u_A = sqrt(u_N * (mu0 [raw]) / (mu0 [si]))
            --> u_A = sqrt(u_N * (1) / (4 * pi * 10^-7))
        Which yields, for charge units:
            u_q = u_A * u_t
        At which point, we have u_l, u_t, u_M, and u_q,
            which is sufficient to infer all other units (aside from K for temperature)
