### User Manual: Code Word Functions for Tigrinya Language Processing

This manual provides a brief explanation of the functions available in the `tigrina_words` module for processing Tigrinya language text. Each function performs a specific task related to translating, encoding, or identifying Tigrinya language elements.

#### 1. **Convert Tigrinya Alphabet to Numeric Code**
   - **Function**: `code_translation("ፈተነ","code","")`
   - **Description**: Converts a Tigrinya word or sentence (e.g., "ፈተነ") into its corresponding numeric code. This is useful for encoding Tigrinya text.

For example, if you have a numeric code and need to retrieve the original Tigrinya word, use the decoding function with the appropriate parameters.

### Additional Functions in `tigrina_words` Module for Tigrinya Language Processing

This section of the manual explains additional functions available in the `tigrina_words` module that focus on verb and adjective creation, stem extraction, noun processing, and sentence breaking for easier translation or processing.

#### 1. **Create Verbs from Stems in Tigrinya**
   - **Function**: `verb.create_verb_from_stem("መጽአ", 'future', 'we', "he", 'ዘይ', "yes")`
   - **Description**: Generates a complete verb from a given stem verb (e.g., "መጽአ") by specifying tense (e.g., 'future'), subject (e.g., 'we'), and other grammatical markers like negation (e.g., 'ዘይ') and aspect (e.g., "yes"). This is useful for constructing conjugated verbs in various forms.

   - **Function**: `verb.create_stem_from_verb("ኣሲርዎ")`
   - **Description**: Extracts the stem from a given Tigrinya verb (e.g., "ኣሲርዎ"). The stem is the base form used to create various conjugations of the verb.

#### 3. **Create Stem Nouns from Nouns in Tigrinya**
   - **Function**: `tigrina_words.noun("ቦርሳታት")`
   - **Description**: Extracts the stem form of a noun (e.g., "ቦርሳታት") in Tigrinya. The stem noun is the base form that can be used to create plural forms, possessives, and other noun modifications.

#### 4. **Create Adjectives from Stem Adjectives in Tigrinya**

   - **Description**: Constructs a full adjective from a stem (e.g., 'ብርቱዕ') by specifying gender, possession, and negation markers (e.g., 'እንተዘይ' for negation). This is useful for generating descriptive words that match the grammatical context.

#### 5. **Create Stem Adjectives from Non-Stem Adjectives in Tigrinya**
   - **Function**: `adjective.make_stem_from_adjective('እንተዝብርትዕ')`
   - **Description**: Extracts the stem form of an adjective (e.g., 'እንተዝብርትዕ'), which can be used to create different forms of the adjective based on gender, number, or negation.

#### 6. **Break Long Sentences into Chunks**
   - **Function**: `break_text("test text here. This is another test.", "")`
   - **Description**: Splits a long sentence or paragraph (e.g., "test text here. This is another test.") into smaller, more manageable chunks. This is particularly useful for processing or translating large texts where sentence-by-sentence translation is required.
#### 7. **Data managment**
   - **Function**: `tigrina_words.Data.select("query selection here to get data from a given table")`
   - **Description**: This helps to get data from already existed tables.
   - **Function**: `tigrina_words.Data.insert("query here to insert data")`
   - **Description**: This helps to insert data to a given table.
   - **Function**: `tigrina_words.Data.update("query here to update data")`

   - **Function**: `tigrina_words.Data.delete("query here to delete data")`
   - **Description**: This helps to delete data in a given table.

   - **Function**: `tigrina_words.pandas_data_frame_to_object(here will be the data retrieved from the tables using the above queries.)`----> This function is only for python. No need to use this in javascript or node js
   - **Description**: This helps to convert the retrieved data query to object. By nature when data is retrieved using the queries, it comes as a pandas object (kind of table structured result). If you want to work with objects, then this query results has to be converted to object. Hence this function helps to do that. Therefore in general this function helps to convert the pandas results to python object query.

#### 8. **data_transformation Function Documentation**
   ###### Overview:
   The data_transformation function reads a CSV file, applies column merging and transformation logic, and saves the modified results into a new CSV file. This function interacts with the tg_code function to merge specific columns and apply a transformation (e.g., translation, concatenation, etc.).

   #### Function Signature:
   def data_transformation(input_csv_path, output_csv_path, column_representing, listOfColumnsToBeCombined):
   ##### Parameters:
   ###### input_csv_path (str):

   The file path of the input CSV that contains the data you want to transform.
   Example: 'input_data.csv'.
   ###### output_csv_path (str):

   The file path where the transformed CSV will be saved.
   Example: 'output_data.csv'.
   ###### column_representing (str):

   The name of the new column that will represent the combined data from the selected columns.
   Example: 'combined_data'.
   ###### listOfColumnsToBeCombined (list of str):

   A list of column names from the input CSV to be merged and transformed.
   Example: ['english', 'tigrina'].
   ###### Returns:
   A string indicating the result of the operation.
   If successful: "saved to <output_csv_path>".
   If there is an error or missing columns: A message indicating the error or missing columns (e.g., "Not found: spanish").
   #### Function Workflow:
   Reading the Input CSV: The function opens the input CSV file (input_csv_path) and reads it using csv.DictReader. Each row is processed as a dictionary where the keys are the column names.

   Processing Each Row: The function loops through each row and calls the tg_code function to process the specified columns. If any required columns are missing, the function returns a message with the missing columns.

   Writing to Output CSV: The function writes the result of tg_code (the combined column value) to a new CSV file (output_csv_path), using the provided column name (column_representing).

   Handling Missing Columns: If any columns are missing, the function will stop and return a message such as "Not found: column_name".

   
   #### tg_code Function Documentation
   Overview:
   The tg_code function processes a row of data, checks if the required columns are present, and combines the values of the specified columns into a single string. If any of the columns are missing, it returns an error message. This function is used internally by data_transformation to perform column merging and transformation.

   Function Signature:
   python
   Copy code
   def tg_code(row, listOfColumnsToBeCombined):
   Parameters:
   row (dict):

   A dictionary representing a row from the input CSV, where the keys are column names and the values are the corresponding data.
   Example: {'english': 'hello', 'tigrina': 'ሰላም', 'spanish': 'hola'}.
   listOfColumnsToBeCombined (list of str):

   A list of column names that should be combined from the row.
   Example: ['english', 'tigrina'].
   Returns:
   A string:
   If all specified columns are found in the row, it returns a combined string of their values.
   If any columns are missing, it returns a message like "Not found: column_name".
   Function Workflow:
   Column Check: The function checks each column in listOfColumnsToBeCombined to see if it exists in the row.

   If a column is found, its value is added to the list filtered_values.
   If a column is missing, it is added to the missing_columns list.
   Missing Column Handling: If any columns are missing, the function returns a message listing those columns (e.g., "Not found: spanish").

   Value Combination: If all required columns are present, their values are combined into a single string, separated by spaces.

   
   Conclusion:
   The data_transformation function allows you to read data from a CSV file, transform it by merging specified columns, and save the result to a new CSV file. It uses the tg_code function to handle the logic of merging and checking columns.
   You can use this structure to combine and process columns from any CSV data, ensuring that missing columns are handled properly.
   
### Usage Examples
These functions are essential for building or breaking down words and sentences in the Tigrinya language, whether for translation, linguistic analysis, or language learning. For instance, if you need to generate a verb from its stem for future tense and a specific subject, you can use the `create_verb_from_stem` function with the relevant parameters. Similarly, to simplify long translations, you can use the `break_text` function to segment the content for easier processing or translation.
