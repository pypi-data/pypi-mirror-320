1. Create a Metaflow flow, say, `HelloFlow`, in a git repo as usual
2. Run it remotely: `python hello.py run --with kubernetes` or `python hello.py run --with batch`
3. Note the run ID in the console or in the UI, e.g. `HelloFlow/5`.
4. Continue editing code
5. Run `metaflow-diff diff HelloFlow/5` to see how the code has changed in the given execution ðŸ’¡

> [!NOTE]
> `metaflow-diff` displays differences only for files associated with the specified run.
> Any new files added to the current working directory that are not part of the run will
> be excluded from the output.
