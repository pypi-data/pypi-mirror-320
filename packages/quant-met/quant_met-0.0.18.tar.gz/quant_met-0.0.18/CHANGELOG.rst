-------------------

Changed
^^^^^^^

- crit-temp routine now saves a sample Hamiltonian besides the critical temperatures

Fixed

0.0.11 — 2024-11-08
-------------------

Changed
^^^^^^^

- Option to set maximum number of iterations in self-consistency loop

.. _changelog-0.0.10:

0.0.10 — 2024-11-06
-------------------

Added
^^^^^

- Gap equation at zero temperature

- Proper logging and debug mode

------------------

Changed
^^^^^^^

- Save all simulation parameters into the output file
