# for metadata to check if there is a difference between
# comicon data and the one in the comicinfo.xml
# NOTE: THERE IS NO AUTHORITATIVE METADATA SOURCE
# comicon.json cannot be assumed to be correct
# we have to merge the two sources of metadata
# if they differ, defer to comicinfo.xml
#
# re chapters: if there is a difference in chapter count,
# defer to comicinfo.xml
# otherwise, defer to comicon.json
