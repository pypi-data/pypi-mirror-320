# Hypercortex Developer Guide

This document provides technical details about the Hypercortex project architecture and implementation.

## Architecture Overview

Hypercortex is structured as a Python package with the following main components:

```
src/hypercortex/
├── __init__.py      # Package initialization
├── utils/           # Utility functions
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── helpers.py   # Helper functions
└── core/            # Core functionality (coming soon)
    └── __init__.py
```

## Design Decisions

### Package Structure
- Using `src/` layout for better package isolation during development
- Separation of concerns between core logic and utilities
- Type hints throughout the codebase for better maintainability

### Development Tools
- uv for fast, reliable package management
- pytest for testing
- black + flake8 + isort for consistent code style
- mypy for static type checking
- pre-commit hooks for automated checks

## Internal APIs

Documentation for internal APIs will be added as they are developed.

## Future Plans

- Add core AI agent functionality
- Implement healthcare payment processing
- Add comprehensive testing suite
- Set up CI/CD pipeline
- Add API documentation

## Performance Considerations

- Type hints are used throughout for better IDE support and catch errors early
- Careful consideration of dependencies to keep the package lightweight
- Planning to add performance benchmarks

## Security Considerations

- All healthcare data must be handled according to HIPAA guidelines
- Planning to add security audit tools
- Will implement proper encryption for sensitive data

## Debugging Tips

- Use mypy for type-related issues
- Enable debug logging (implementation coming soon)
- Use pytest with -v flag for verbose test output
