## 🥂💃🕺 Welcome to the Party! 🥂💃🕺

Kegstand is a free and open-source framework for creating Python APIs and services. It allows you to rapidly build and deploy services on AWS. We all have better things to do than `print(json.dumps(event))` all day long, and Kegstand is here to help you get to the party &mdash; _and into Prod_ &mdash; a lot faster.

**It provides:**

- A CLI tool for creating and deploying your services.
- A decorator based framework abstracting away the boilerplate of AWS Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, and more.
- The full power of CDK to define and deploy arbitrary AWS resources with your services.

## Prerequisites

- Supports [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) or [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)
- AWS CLI [configured with credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html)
- AWS CDK CLI [configured and initialized](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/latest/guide/getting_started.html)
- A well-poured [Belgian style brown ale](https://www.grimbergen.com/)

## Quick start

To create a service with Kegstand, you'll need a Python project with a few dependencies and a folder structure following the Kegstand convention.

You can create this in a few seconds, either with the Kegstand CLI or using [Copier](https://copier.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#installation).

```shell
# Using the Kegstand CLI
> pipx install kegstandcli
> keg new my-service

# Using Copier
> copier copy -d project_name=my-service gh:JensRoland/kegstand-project-template .
```

Either method will create a new project folder called `my-service` containing:

```shell
📁 my-service
├── 📄 .gitignore                    # Standard .gitignore file
├── 📄 pyproject.toml                # Project configuration
└── 📁 src
    └── 📁 api
        └── 📁 public
            └── 📄 hello.py          # Logic for /hello/
```

Kegstand projects are minimal by design, so a fresh project folder contains just those 3 files. Well, apart from a few empty `__init__.py` gatecrashers, but we can safely ignore those.

Install the dependencies for the new project (uv will do this for you during `uv run` so it's not strictly necessary):

```shell
> cd my-service
> uv sync
```

Finally, to build and deploy the service to AWS:

```shell
> uv run keg deploy
```

> **Note**: Even if you installed the Kegstand CLI globally with `pipx`, it is still recommended to use `uv run` to ensure that you are using the correct CLI version for the specific project.

You should now be able to access the API endpoint at `https://<api-id>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com/prod/hello`.
