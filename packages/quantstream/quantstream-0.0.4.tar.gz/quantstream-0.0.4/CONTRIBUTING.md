   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-new-model
   ```

1. **Make Your Changes**: Develop your feature or fix. Ensure your code adheres to the projectâ€™s coding standards (see Code Style and Linting).

1. **Run Tests**: Run all tests to make sure your changes do not break any existing functionality.

   ```bash

1. **Review Process**: Your pull request will be reviewed by project maintainers. Please be open to feedback and make any necessary changes.

## Code Style and Linting

QuantStream follows standard Python coding conventions and uses `ruff` for code linting. Please ensure that your code adheres to the following style guidelines:

- **Code Linting**: Run `ruff` to check code style:

  ```bash
  uv run ruff check .
  ```

- **Code Formatting**: Use `black` to format the code before submitting a pull request.

  ```bash
  uv run black .
  ```
