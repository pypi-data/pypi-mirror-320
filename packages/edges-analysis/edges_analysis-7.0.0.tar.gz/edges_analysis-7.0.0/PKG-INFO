**Code for analysing EDGES field data.**

``edges-analysis`` has methods for averaging, filtering and calibrating EDGES data
from the field. It also includes classes for describing the products of these analysis
steps. The primary goal of the code is to allow the analysis to be fully reproducible,
efficient, and clear.

.. note:: This code originated from Raul Monsalve's private repo.
          The original code before modification is tagged as ``original_version``.

Features
========

``edges-analysis`` includes the following features:

* A well-defined class-based interface to generic single-dish data for global-signal
  measurements.
* Full tracking of input metadata across all analysis steps.
* Compact command-line interface for running each step.
* Beam models
* Loss models
* Various filters that are able to flag out potentially bad data.
* Sky Models



Installation
============

This package can be installed with ``pip`` either by cloning the repo first, or directly
from github::

    cd edges-analysis
    pip install [-e] .

or::

    pip install git+git://github.com/edges-collab/edges-analysis.git
