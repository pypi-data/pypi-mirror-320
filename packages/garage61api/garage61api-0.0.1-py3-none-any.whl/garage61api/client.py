        Detailed Info: https://garage61.net/developer/endpoints/v1/findLaps

        Lap Filtering Docs: https://garage61.net/docs/usage/filtering

        The drivers selected by "drivers" are combined with those from the "teams" and "extra_drivers" parameters. If none of these parameters are given, yourself and all teammates will be selected.

        Limitations

        This method only returns laps driven yourself or your teammates. Use the relevant parameters to choose the desired selection of laps. For privacy reasons, no global lap search is available.
        Data returned adheres to the defined privacy settings and is thus specific to the user linked to the API token.

        :param tracks: track IDs to search for (int or list of ints).
        :param iracing_seasons: season IDs to search for (int or list of ints). Seasons (and their IDs) can be found in the ".platforms".
        :param drivers: drivers to include. Available values: me, following (str or list of str).
        :param extra_drivers: extra drivers to include (by user slug) (str or list of str).
        :param age: maximum lap age. Any positive number represents the maximum number of days ago (e.g. 7 would restrict the search to all laps driven in the past week). A negative value is interpreted as follows: Current season: -1; Current and previous season: -2; Last 3 seasons: -3; Last 4 seasons: -4.
        :param date_after: laps driven after given date (datetime or str).
