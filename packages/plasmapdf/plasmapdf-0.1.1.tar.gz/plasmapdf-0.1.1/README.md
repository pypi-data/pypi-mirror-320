# PlasmaPDF Quick Start Guide

PlasmaPDF is a Python library for converting from txt spans to x-y positioned tokens in the PAWLs format. It is a utility library used in OpenContracts and PdfRedactor. 

## Installation

To install PlasmaPDF, use pip:

```
pip install plasmapdf
```

## Basic Usage

### 1. Importing the Library

Start by importing the necessary components:

```python
from plasmapdf.models.PdfDataLayer import build_translation_layer
from plasmapdf.models.types import TextSpan, SpanAnnotation, PawlsPagePythonType
```

### 2. Creating a PdfDataLayer

The core of plasmaPDF is the `PdfDataLayer` class. You create an instance of this class using
the `makePdfTranslationLayerFromPawlsTokens` function:

```python
pawls_tokens: list[PawlsPagePythonType] = [
    {
        "page": {"width": 612, "height": 792, "index": 0},
        "tokens": [
            {"x": 72, "y": 72, "width": 50, "height": 12, "text": "Hello"},
            {"x": 130, "y": 72, "width": 50, "height": 12, "text": "World"}
        ]
    }
]

pdf_data_layer = makePdfTranslationLayerFromPawlsTokens(pawls_tokens)
```

### 3. Working with Text Spans

You can extract raw text from a span in the document:

```python
span = TextSpan(id="1", start=0, end=11, text="Hello World")
raw_text = pdf_data_layer.get_raw_text_from_span(span)
print(raw_text)  # Output: "Hello World"
```

### 4. Creating Annotations

To create an annotation:

```python
span_annotation = SpanAnnotation(span=span, annotation_label="GREETING")
oc_annotation = pdf_data_layer.create_opencontract_annotation_from_span(span_annotation)
```

### 5. Accessing Document Information

You can access various pieces of information about the document:

```python
print(pdf_data_layer.doc_text)  # Full document text
print(pdf_data_layer.human_friendly_full_text)  # Human-readable version of the text
print(pdf_data_layer.page_dataframe)  # DataFrame with page information
print(pdf_data_layer.tokens_dataframe)  # DataFrame with token information
```

## Development Setup

PlasmaPDF uses `hatch` for environment and development workflow management. Here's how to get started:

### 1. Install Hatch

First, install hatch globally:

```bash
pip install hatch
```

### 2. Development Environment

Hatch automatically manages virtual environments for you. To activate the development environment:

```bash
hatch shell dev
```

### 3. Running Tests

PlasmaPDF uses pytest for testing. To run tests:

```bash
hatch run dev:pytest
```

For tests with coverage:

```bash
hatch run dev:pytest --cov
```

### 4. Code Quality Tools

PlasmaPDF comes with several code quality tools configured:

#### Formatting
To format your code using `black` and `isort`:

```bash
hatch run dev:format
```

#### Linting
To run flake8 linting:

```bash
hatch run dev:lint
```

#### Type Checking
To run mypy type checking:

```bash
hatch run types:check
```

### 5. Environment Details

PlasmaPDF defines several hatch environments in `pyproject.toml`:

- `dev`: Main development environment with testing and formatting tools
- `types`: Environment for type checking with mypy

Each environment has its own dependencies and scripts defined in `pyproject.toml`.

### 6. Code Style

The project follows these standards:
- Line length: 88 characters (Black default)
- Python version: 3.8+
- Strict type checking with mypy
- Black code style
- Isort for import sorting (configured to be compatible with Black)

## Advanced Usage

### Working with Multi-Page Documents

PlasmaPDF can handle multi-page documents. When you create the `PdfDataLayer`, make sure to include tokens for all
pages:

```python
multi_page_pawls_tokens = [
    {
        "page": {"width": 612, "height": 792, "index": 0},
        "tokens": [...]
    },
    {
        "page": {"width": 612, "height": 792, "index": 1},
        "tokens": [...]
    }
]

pdf_data_layer = makePdfTranslationLayerFromPawlsTokens(multi_page_pawls_tokens)
```

### Splitting Spans Across Pages

If you have a span that potentially crosses page boundaries, you can split it:

```python
long_span = TextSpan(id="2", start=0, end=1000, text="...")
page_aware_spans = pdf_data_layer.split_span_on_pages(long_span)
```

### Creating OpenContracts Annotations

To create an annotation in the OpenContracts format:

```python
span = TextSpan(id="3", start=0, end=20, text="Important clause here")
span_annotation = SpanAnnotation(span=span, annotation_label="IMPORTANT_CLAUSE")
oc_annotation = pdf_data_layer.create_opencontract_annotation_from_span(span_annotation)
```

## Utility Functions

PlasmaPDF includes utility functions for working with job results:

```python
from plasmapdf.utils.utils import package_job_results_to_oc_generated_corpus_type

# Assume you have job_results, possible_span_labels, possible_doc_labels, 
# possible_relationship_labels, and suggested_label_set

corpus = package_job_results_to_oc_generated_corpus_type(
    job_results,
    possible_span_labels,
    possible_doc_labels,
    possible_relationship_labels,
    suggested_label_set
)
```

This function packages job results into the OpenContracts corpus format.

## Testing

PlasmaPDF comes with a suite of unit tests. You can run these tests to ensure everything is working correctly:

```
hatch test
```

This will run all the tests in the `tests` directory.
