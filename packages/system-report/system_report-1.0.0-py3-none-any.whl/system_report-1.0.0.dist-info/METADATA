# System Report

System Report is a Python package designed to generate and save a detailed system report, including information about the operating system, CPU, memory, and disk usage.

## Features
- Collect system information, such as OS version, hostname, CPU, memory, and disk details.
- Format values in a human-readable way (e.g., GB, MB).
- Save the system report as a JSON file.
- Easily extensible and includes unit tests.

## Installation

You can install the package locally:

```bash
pip install .
```

## Usage

To generate and save a system report, run the following command:

```bash
python -m system_report
```

This will create a `system_report.json` file in the current working directory.

## Running Tests

The package includes unit tests written with `pytest`. To execute the tests and generate a report in JUnit XML format, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install pytest
   ```

2. Run the tests and generate the report:

   ```bash
   python -m pytest --junitxml=report.xml
   ```

This will run all tests and save the test results in a file named `report.xml`.

## Publishing the Package to PyPI

To publish the package to PyPI, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the required tools installed:

   ```bash
   pip install twine setuptools wheel
   ```

2. Build the package:

   ```bash
   python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   ```

3. Upload the package to PyPI:
