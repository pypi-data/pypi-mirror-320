### Linux ###
**1.** Update the changelog on CHANGELOG.md.

**2.** Commit changes and create a git tag with appropriate version.

**3.** Remove old distribution in the directory `rm -rf dist/*`

```bash
[testpypi]
  username = __token__
  password = token-from-test-pypi-account
```
or 
```bash
[pypi]
  username = __token__
  password = token-from-pypi-account
```
**8.** Upload using twine to testpypi
```bash
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* --verbose
```
or to pypi
