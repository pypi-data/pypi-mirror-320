# ARTOF
The ARTOF package is a tool to read, process and analyze data collected from angle resolved time of flight (ARTOF) sensors.

## Getting started
To use this package python version >=3.10 is needed. The installation can be done using the command:
```
pip install ARTOF
```


## Documentation
The documenation can be found [here](Documentation.md). It is automatically generated from the docstrings in all python classes.

## Workflow
The implementation of a new feature should be conducted as follows:
1. Create a new branch with a sensible name as a fork from `dev`.
2. Implement features.
3. Check if all excisting tests are still working (cmd: `pytest`) and write new test functions using.
5. If there were changes to `dev` since the initial fork, merge it into your branch and resolve conflicts.
4. Increase version number in `setup.cfg` file.
6. Push all changes to the remote repository and create a merge request to `dev`.
7. Make sure all tests succeed in the pipeline and merge.
8. Create a merge request to `main` once enough features accumulated to roll out a new version. Make again sure all test pipelines succeed.
9. After merging to `main` a new version of the package is released to PyPi upon a successful pipeline run.
