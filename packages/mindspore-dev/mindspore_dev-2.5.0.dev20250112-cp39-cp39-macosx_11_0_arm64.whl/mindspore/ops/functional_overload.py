    all_gather_matmul(input, x2, group, world_size, *, bias=None, gather_index=0, gather_output=True, comm_turn=0, trans_input=False, trans_x2=False) -> Tensor

    In the TP segmentation scenario, allgather and matmul are fused, and communication and computational pipelines
    are parallelized within the fusion operator.

    .. math::
        output = allgather(input)@x2

        gather\_out = allgather(input)

    .. warning::
        This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): The left matrix of matmul, the dtype supports float16 and bfloat16, the shape supports 2
            dimensions, and the data format supports ND.
        x2 (Tensor): The right matrix of matmul, the dtype needs to be consistent with ``input`` , the shape
            supports 2 dimensions, and the data format supports ND.
        group (str): Communication group name, can be created by ``create_group`` method, or use the default group
            ``mindspore.communication.GlobalComm.WORLD_COMM_GROUP``.
        world_size (int): The total number of ranks in the communication group, should be consistent with the number
            of devices actually running, supporting ``2`` , ``4`` , and ``8`` .

    Keyword Args:
        bias (Tensor, optional): Currently only ``None`` is supported. Default: ``None`` .
        gather_index (int, optional): Indicates the allgather operation object, ``0`` means gather ``input`` ,

    Returns:
        - output (Tensor) - The result of allgather and matmul fusion calculations.
        - gather_out (Tensor) - The result of allgather. If gather_output is ``False`` , ``gather_out`` returns a
          tensor with shape 0.

          range of k is [256, 65535). The shape of ``output`` is (m * world_size, n), and the shape of
          ``gather_out`` is (m * world_size, k).
