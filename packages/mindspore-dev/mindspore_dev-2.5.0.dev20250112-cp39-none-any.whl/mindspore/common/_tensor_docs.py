attach_docstr("scatter_", r"""scatter_(dim, index, src) -> Tensor

Update the value in `src` to update `self` according to the specified `index`.

Index the dimension `self` selected by `dim` using `index` , traverse the other
dimensions in sequence, update the value of `src` to `self` , and return `self` .

This operator is the inverse of the in-place version of :func:`mindspore.Tensor.gather` .

This operation provides another three overloads to support parameter `reduce` and scalar value.

Here's an example using a 3-dimension tensor.

.. code-block::

.. warning::
    - If multiple indexes point to the same position in `self` , the final value of
      this position in `self` is uncertain.
    - On Ascend, behavior is unpredictable when the value of `index` is not in the
      range `[-self.shape[dim], self.shape[dim])` in forward.
    - This is an experimental API that is subject to change or deletion.

.. method:: Tensor.scatter_add(indices, updates) -> Tensor
    :noindex:

Creates a new tensor by adding the values from the positions in `self` indicated by
`indices`, with values from `updates`. When multiple values are given for the same
index, the updated result will be the sum of all values. This operation is almost
equivalent to using ScatterNdAdd, except that the updates are applied on output `Tensor`
instead of input `Parameter`.

The last axis of `indices` is the depth of each index vectors. For each index vector,
there must be a corresponding value in `updates`. The shape of `updates` should be
equal to the shape of `self[indices]`. For more details, see Examples.

.. math::
    output\left [indices  \right ] = input\_x + update

.. note::
    The dimension of this tensor `self` must be no less than indices.shape[-1].

    If some values of the `indices` are out of bound:

    - On GPU, if some values of the `indices` are out of bound, instead of raising an index error,
      the corresponding `updates` will not be updated to self tensor.
    - On CPU, if some values of the `indices` are out of bound, raising an index error.
    - On Ascend, out of bound checking is not supported, if some values of the `indices` are out of bound,
      unknown errors may be caused.

Args:
    indices (Tensor): The index of input tensor whose data type is int32 or int64.
        The rank must be at least 2.
    updates (Tensor): The tensor to update the input tensor, has the same type as input,
        and updates. And the shape should be
        equal to :math:`indices.shape[:-1] + input\_x.shape[indices.shape[-1]:]`.

Returns:
    Tensor, has the same shape and type as `self`.

Raises:
    TypeError: If dtype of `indices` is neither int32 nor int64.
    ValueError: If length of shape of `self` is less than the last dimension of shape of `indices`.
    RuntimeError: If a value of `indices` is not in `self` on CPU backend.

      they must be able to broadcast to a common shape.
    - The two inputs and alpha comply with the implicit type conversion rules to make the data types
      consistent.

Args:
    other (Union[Tensor, number.Number, bool]): The second self, is a number.Number or
        a bool or a tensor whose data type is
        `number <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore/mindspore.dtype.html>`_ or
        `bool_ <https://www.mindspore.cn/docs/en/master/api_python/mindspore/mindspore.dtype.html>`_.

Keyword Args:
    alpha (number.Number, optional): A scaling factor applied to `other`, default ``1``.

Returns:
    Tensor with a shape that is the same as the broadcasted shape of the self `self` and `other`,
    and the data type is the one with higher precision or higher digits among the two inputs and alpha.

Raises:
    TypeError: If the type of `other` or `alpha` is not one of the following: Tensor, number.Number, bool.
    TypeError: If `alpha` is of type float but `self` and `other` are not of type float.
    TypeError: If `alpha` is of type bool but `self` and `other` are not of type bool.

.. method:: Tensor.sum(axis=None, dtype=None, keepdims=False, initial=None) -> Tensor
    :noindex:

Return sum of tensor elements over a given axis.

Note:
    Numpy arguments `out`, `where`, `casting`, `order`, `subok`, `signature`, and `extobj` are not supported.
    The `axis` with tensor type is only used for compatibility with older versions and is not recommended.

Args:
    axis (Union[None, int, tuple(int), list(int), Tensor], optional): Axis or axes along which a sum is performed.
        Default: ``None`` .
        If ``None`` , sum all the elements of the self tensor.
        If the `axis` is negative, it counts from the last to the first `axis`.
        If the `axis` is a tuple or list of ints, a sum is performed on all the axes specified in the tuple
        or list instead of a single `axis` or all the axes as before.
    dtype (:class:`mindspore.dtype`, optional): Default: ``None`` . Overrides the dtype of the
        output Tensor.
    keepdims (bool, optional): If this is set to ``True`` , the axes which are reduced are left in the result as
        dimensions with size one. With this option, the result will broadcast correctly against the self
        array. If the default value is passed, then `keepdims` will not be passed through to the sum method
        of sub-classes of ndarray, however any non-default value will be. If the sub-class method does not
        implement `keepdims` any exceptions will be raised. Default: ``False`` .
    initial (scalar, optional): Starting value for the sum. Default: ``None`` .

Returns:
    Tensor. A tensor with the same shape as self, with the specified `axis` removed.
    If the self tensor is a 0-d array, or if the `axis` is ``None`` , a scalar is returned.

Raises:
    TypeError: If self is not array_like, or `axis` is not int, tuple of ints, list of ints or Tensor,
        or `keepdims` is not integer, or `initial` is not scalar.

attach_docstr("topk", r"""topk(k, dim=-1, largest=True, sorted=True) -> tuple(Tensor, Tensor)

Finds values and indices of the `k` largest or smallest entries along a given dimension.

.. warning::
    - If sorted is set to False, due to different memory layout and traversal methods on different platforms,
      the display order of calculation results may be inconsistent when `sorted` is False.

If the `self` is a one-dimensional Tensor, finds the `k` largest or smallest entries in the Tensor,
and outputs its value and index as a Tensor. `values[k]` is the `k` largest item in `self`,
and its index is `indices[k]` .

For a multi-dimensional matrix,
calculates the first or last `k` entries in a given dimension, therefore:

.. math::

    values.shape = indices.shape

If the two compared elements are the same, the one with the smaller index value is returned first.

Args:
    k (int): The number of top or bottom elements to be computed along the last dimension.
    dim (int, optional): The dimension to sort along. Default: ``-1`` .
    largest (bool, optional): If largest is ``False``  then the k smallest elements are returned.
        Default: ``True`` .
    sorted (bool, optional): If ``True`` , the obtained elements will be sorted by the values in descending
        order or ascending order according to `largest`. If ``False`` , the obtained elements will not be
        sorted. Default: ``True`` .

Returns:
    A tuple consisting of `values` and `indices`.

    - values (Tensor) - The `k` largest or smallest elements in each slice of the given dimension.
    - indices (Tensor) - The indices of values within the last dimension of self.

Raises:

.. method:: Tensor.transpose(*axes) -> Tensor
    :noindex:

Permutes the dimensions of the self tensor according to self permutation.

For a 1-D array this has no effect, as a transposed vector is simply the same vector.
To convert a 1-D array into a 2D column vector please refer to :func:`mindspore.ops.expand_dims`.
For a 2-D array, this is a standard matrix transpose. For an n-D array, if axes are given,
their order indicates how the axes are permuted (see Examples).
If axes are not provided and a.shape is :math:`(i[0], i[1], ... i[n-2], i[n-1])`,
then a.transpose().shape is :math:`(i[n-1], i[n-2], ... i[1], i[0])`.

Note:
    On GPU and CPU, if the value of `axes` is negative, its actual value is `axes[i] + rank(self)`.

Args:
    axes (tuple[int]): The permutation to be converted. The elements in `axes` are composed of the
        indexes of each dimension of `self`. The length of `axes` and the shape of `self` must be the
        same. Only constant value is allowed. Must be in the range [-rank(self), rank(self)).

.. method:: Tensor.var(dim=None, *, correction=1, keepdim=False) -> Tensor
    :noindex:

Calculates the variance over the dimensions specified by `dim`. `dim` can be a single dimension, list of
dimensions, or None to reduce over all dimensions.

The variance (:math:`\delta ^2`) is calculated as:

.. math::
    \delta ^2 = \frac{1}{\max(0, N - \delta N)}\sum^{N - 1}_{i = 0}(x_i - \bar{x})^2

where :math:`x` is the sample set of elements, :math:`\bar{x}` is the sample mean, :math:`N` is the number
of samples and :math:`\delta N` is the `correction`.

Args:
    dim (None, int, tuple(int), optional): The dimension or dimensions to reduce. Defaults to ``None``.
        If ``None``, all dimensions are reduced.

Keyword Args:
    correction (int, optional): The difference between the sample size and sample degrees of freedom. Defaults
        to Bessel's correction. Defaults to ``1``.
    keepdim (bool, optional): Whether the output tensor has dim retained or not. If ``True`` , keep these
        reduced dimensions and the length is 1. If ``False``, don't keep these dimensions. Defaults to ``False``.

Returns:
    Tensor, the variance.
    Suppose the shape of `self` is :math:`(x_0, x_1, ..., x_R)`:

    - If `dim` is () and `keepdim` is set to ``False`` , returns a 0-D Tensor, indicating the variance of all
      elements in `self`.
    - If `dim` is int, e.g. ``1`` and `keepdim` is set to ``False`` , then the returned Tensor has shape
      :math:`(x_0, x_2, ..., x_R)`.
    - If `dim` is tuple(int) or list(int), e.g. ``(1, 2)`` and `keepdim` is set to ``False`` , then the returned
      Tensor has shape :math:`(x_0, x_3, ..., x_R)`.

Raises:
    TypeError: If `dim` is not one of the followings: None, int, list, tuple.
    TypeError: If `correction` is not an int.
    TypeError: If `keepdim` is not a bool.
