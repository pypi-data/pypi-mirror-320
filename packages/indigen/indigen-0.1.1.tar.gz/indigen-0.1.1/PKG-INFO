Description: 
        # IndiGen: A Python-Based Synthetic Name Generator for Indian States
        
        This package is a dynamic state-based Indian name generator. It allows users to generate names (either first names or full names)
        for specific states or for all states of India at once. The system dynamically imports state-specific modules and their corresponding
        name generation functions.
        
        Need for an Indian Name Generator:
        India is a diverse country with a rich tapestry of cultures, languages, and traditions. 
        Each state has unique naming conventions that reflect its cultural and linguistic identity.
        An Indian name generator addresses this diversity and caters to various applications requiring culturally specific names.
        
        This project caters to various applications, including:
        - **Diversity Representation**: Ensuring names reflect India's unique cultural tapestry.
        - **Localization**: Supporting region-specific datasets for marketing, content creation, and more.
        - **Research**: Facilitating analysis of naming trends across Indian states.
        
        
        ## Features
        
        - Dynamically loads state-specific modules for name generation.
        - Generates first names or full names for specific states or all Indian states.
        - Customizable output: specify the number of names to generate.
        - Comprehensive error handling for invalid inputs or module issues
