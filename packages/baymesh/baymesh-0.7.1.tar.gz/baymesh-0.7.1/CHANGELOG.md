# CHANGELOG


## v0.7.1 (2025-01-12)

### Bug Fixes

- Fall back to sleeping through reboots
  ([`0bb5b55`](https://github.com/gtaylor/baymesh-cli/commit/0bb5b559bccca0c1e3b6f79990584b27c59b6bd8))

I had originally tried to find a way to wait for nodes to reboot when applying settings to keep
  things fast and dynamic, but I couldn't find a safe way to detect when the node was back up 100%
  of the time on all of the devices I had.

Fall back to a plain old sleep and let's hope that most devices reboot within 10 seconds.

- Remove unused imports
  ([`966e337`](https://github.com/gtaylor/baymesh-cli/commit/966e3373b60d567cdb99fa76f19673b92d186221))

  ([`c5d8e39`](https://github.com/gtaylor/baymesh-cli/commit/c5d8e39633c8241349b2fa33fc8d19e3fff6a412))

The wizard will walk the user through configuring the essential settings for the node. For ex: LoRa
  preset, long/short names, etc.

- Add version checking
  ([`31bc074`](https://github.com/gtaylor/baymesh-cli/commit/31bc0740c299840c94f3242e9253ca758ae18e5d))

Since the recommended configs may change over time, it's important that users stay up to date. This
  commit adds a facility for checking for updates and notifying the user if a newer version is
  available.

For now we're checking on every command invocation, but we can cache this in the future if it
  becomes problematic.
