## Background

I developed `mkdocs-caption` when I switched from  [Antora](https://antora.org/) ([AsciiDoc](https://asciidoc.org/)) to [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and was missing a native and comprehensive figure and table caption system.

`mkdocs-caption` uses many ideas and markdown syntax from [flywire/caption](https://github.com/flywire/caption), which itself is a fork of [yafg](https://git.sr.ht/~ferruck/yafg) - yet another figure generator plugin for Python's Markdown. Although initially developed separately and not sharing any code, I was made aware of [flywire/caption](https://github.com/flywire/caption), and it's worth crediting it here.

## Documentation

For full documentation, visit [https://tobiasah.github.io/mkdocs-caption/](https://tobiasah.github.io/mkdocs-caption/).

## Installation

```console
pip install mkdocs-caption
```

## Quick Usage

In `mkdocs.yml`: 

```
...
plugins:
- caption
```

Inside the Markdown, the following will now be converted into a figure/table with 
caption and numbering.

```
![figure caption](img.jpg)

Table: table caption

| heading 1| heading 2 | 
| - | - | 
| content 1 | content 2 |
| content 3 | content 4 | 
```
```
<p>
  <figure id=_figure-1>
    <img src="img.jpg" />
    <figcaption>Figure 1. figure caption</figcaption>
  </figure>
</p>
<p>
<table id="_table_1">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>heading 1</th>
      <th>heading 2</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>content 1</td>
      <td>content 2</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>content 3</td>
      <td>content 4</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  <caption>Table 1: table caption</caption>
</table>
```
