UOM code for ordering a "case" of product.

Sideshow will treat "case" orders somewhat differently as compared to
"unit" orders.

UOM code for ordering a "unit" of product.

This is the default "unit" UOM but in practice all others are treated
the same by Sideshow, whereas "case" orders are treated somewhat
differently.

"""
UOM code for ordering a "kilogram" of product.

This is treated same as "unit" by Sideshow.  However it should
(probably?) only be used for items where
e.g. :attr:`~sideshow.db.model.orders.OrderItem.product_weighed` is
true.

UOM code for ordering a "pound" of product.
