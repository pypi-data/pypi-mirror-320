Crypto-licensing is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3
(or later) and is also available under alternative licenses negotiated directly
with Dominion Research & Development Corp.  If you obtained slip39 under the
GPL, then the GPL applies to all slip39 modules used on your system as well,
except as defined below. The GPL (version 3) is included in this source tree in
the file COPYING.

Dominion Research & Development Corp. holds copyright and/or sufficient licenses
to all components of the crypto-licensing package, and therefore can grant, at
its sole discretion, the ability for companies, individuals, or organizations to
create proprietary or Open Source (even if not GPL) modules which may use at
runtime the portions of crypto-licensing which fall under our copyright/license
umbrella, or are distributed under more flexible licenses than GPL.

If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry -- there is no
requirement that you provide the same exception in your GPL'd products.
