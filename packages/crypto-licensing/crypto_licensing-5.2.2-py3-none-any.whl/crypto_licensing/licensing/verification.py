    """The key/value capabilities granted by something like a License.  The first level names
    (typically something related to the product name) usually specify a dict of key/value pairs, and
    all must be serializable to JSON.  The values may themselves be Grants.  Specifically, the first
    layer Grant is usually comprised of a couple of "global" values (eg. { "timespan": <Timespan>,
    "machine": <UUID> }, and the remaining values will themselves be Grants, eg. w/ a ._from
    indicating which LicenseSigned dependency they were initially from.

    The Granted option names cannot be trusted; any License may carry a Grant of any option name
    whatsoever.  So, the License itself must be validated as being issued by an expected author,
    before its Grant of options can be trusted.  When a sub-License modifies a Grant (ie. issues a
    subset of the granted capability to a licensee), it modifies the Grant, but retains the original
    source License in _from.  So, when the grants() are finally delivered to the caller, they can
    confirm that the top-level key (eg. "cpppo-test" = Grant( "Hz" = 100 ),_from=<LicenseSigned>)
    actual came from the expected author (ie. has the correct pubkey).

    Also, some License options granted in sub-Licenses may "accumulate", while others only accrue
    to the direct client of the License.  Each License author must decide this; only their code
    that validates their License knows the semantics of their Grant options.

    We'll use a __dict__ instead of __slots__ to hold the unknown option key/dict pairs.

    Two Licenses containing grants from same Grant group (say, 'cpppo-test') "combine" if they are
    loaded in parallel, but "refine" if they are dependencies.  For example, if I load two Licenses
    with Grant.cpppo-test["Hz"] of 1,000 and 200 respectively, I end up with a total Grant of 1,200
    "Hz".  However, if a License contains a Grant of 200, and has a License in its dependencies that
    grants() 1,000, I receive only the 200 (and it must be <= the dependencies' value).

    The Grant &= Grant operator "refines", the Grant |= Grant "combines".

    Note that combining Timespans between two licenses along with other features may grant
    unexpected results -- extending the time duration of the features granted in one license, into
    to the time duration of another license carrying different features.

    Verifying a License
    -------------------

    A signed license is a claim by an Author that the License is valid; it is up to a recipient to
    check that the License also actually satisfies the constraints of any License dependencies.  A
    nefarious Author could create a License and properly sign it -- but not satisfy the License
    constraints.  License.verify(confirm=True) will do this, as well as (optionally) retrieve and
    verify from DNS the public keys of the (claimed) signed License dependencies.

    Checking your License
    ---------------------

    Each module that uses crypto_licensing.licensing checks that the final product's License or its
    parents contains valid license(s) for itself, somewhere within the License dependencies tree.

    All start times are expressed in the UTC timezone; if we used the local timezone (as computed
    using get_localzone, wrapped to respect any TZ environment variable, and made available as
    timestamp.LOC), then serializations (and hence signatures and signature tests) would be
    inconsistent.

    Licenses for products are signed by the author using their signing key.  The corresponding
    public key is expected to be found in a DKIM entry; eg. for Dominion's Cpppo (test) product:

        cpppo-test.crypto-licensing._domainkey.dominionrnd.com. 300 IN \
            TXT "v=DKIM1; k=ed25519; p=qZERnjDZZTmnDNNJg90AcUJZ+LYKIWO9t0jz/AzwNsk="

    TODO:

    License Grant Validation
    ------------------------

    The core purpose of crypto-licensing is to verify the integrity of License grants/constraints at
    License issuance time, and (later) at License utilization time(s).  Only the License Author can
    know the full semantics of their unique License grants/constraints, and the outstanding valid
    Licenses that have been issued.  These must therefore be expressed in a way that is useful to
    the Python crypto_licensing.licensing server (Python), and to the crypto_licensing runtime
    client (also Python).

    Sub-Licensing
    -------------

    When an Author grants a licensee permission to (in turn) author Licenses, there is no way to
    ensure that they actually abide by the constraints granted them.  If they are given permission
    to author (say) 10 machine-IDs, nothing prevents them from signing and issuing 100 instead.
    Even if you issue the Licenses directly with a crypto_licensing.license server under your
    control, nothing prevents the client from running 100 machines with the same machine-ID.

    Any software-based licensing scheme suffers from the same risks; once software is deployed,
    there are no limits on the modifications that a recipient can perform on the software.  TPM
    modules can be used to ensure a full stack of software (from boot loader through the OS) is not
    tampered with, but this Licensing is beyond the scope of that controlled stack.

    Therefore, the purpose of checking Licenses is not to *prevent* unlicensed usage by malevolent
    non-clients -- it is to *enable* licensed usage by your friendly clients.  They need your help,
    via License verification, to do this.

    They want to pay you for your services, and crypto-licensing helps you to help them do that.

    Grant Validation
    ----------------

    Licenses may carry optional grants/constraints, with functions to validate their values.  These
    may be expressed in terms of all Licenses issued by the Author.  During normal License.verify of
    an installed License, nothing about the pool of issued Licenses is known, so no additional
    verification can be done -- it is assumed that the License Author was satisfied when the License
    was issued (signed).

    However, when an Author is issuing a License and has access to the full pool of issued Licenses,
    all presently issued values of the grant/constraint are known.

    If a lambda is provided it will be passed a proposed value as its second default parameter, with
    the first parameter defaulting to None, or a list containing all present instances of the
    constraint across all currently valid Licenses.  For example, if only 10 machine licenses are
    available, return the provided machine if the number is not exhausted:

        machine = "00010203-0405-4607-8809-0a0b0c0d0e0f"
        machine__verifier = lambda m, ms=None: \
            ( str( m ) \
              if len( str( m ).split( '-' )) == 5 \
              else ValueError( f"{m} doesn't look like a UUID" ) \
            if ms is None or len( ms ) < 10 \
            else ValueError( "No more machine licenses presently available" )

    Alternatively, a None or numeric limit could be distributed across all issued licenses:

        targets = 3
        targets__verifier = lambda n, ns=None: \
            None if n is None else int( n ) \
              if n is None or ns is None or int( n ) + sum( map( int, filter( None, ns ))) <= 100 \
              else ValueError( f"{n} exceeds {100-sum(map(int,filter(None,ns)))} targets available" )

    If an Exception is returned, it will be raised.  Otherwise, the result of the lambda will be
    used as the License' value for the constraint.

    The public key of the author must be confirmed through independent means.  One typical means is
    by checking publication on the author's domain (the default behaviour w/ confirm=None), eg.:

        awesome-tool.crypto-licensing._domainkey.awesome-inc.com 86400 IN TXT \
            "v=DKIM1; k=ed25519; p=PW847sz.../M+/GZc="


    Authoring a License
    -------------------

    A software issuer (or end-user, in the case of machine-specific or numerically limited Licenses)
    must create new Licenses.

        >>> from crypto_licensing import authoring, issue, verify, License, Agent

    First, create a Keypair, including both signing (private, .sk) and verifying (public, .vk) keys:

        >>> signing_keypair = authoring( seed=b'our secret 32-byte seed material' )

    Then, create a License, identifying the author by their public key, and the product.  This
    example is a perpetual license (no start/length), for any machine.

        >>> license = License(				\
                author	= Agent(			 \
                    name	= "Awesome, Inc.",	  \
                    domain	= "awesome-inc.com",	   \
                    product	= "Awesome Tool",	    \
                    pubkey	= signing_keypair.vk,	     \
                ),					      \
                confirm=False,				       \
        )

    Finally, issue the LicenseSigned containing the License and its Ed25519 Signature provenance:

        >>> provenance = issue( license, signing_keypair, confirm=False )
        >>> provenance_ser = provenance.serialize( indent=4 )
        >>> print( provenance_ser.decode( 'UTF-8' ) )
        {
            "license":{
                "author":{
                    "domain":"awesome-inc.com",
                    "name":"Awesome, Inc.",
                    "product":"Awesome Tool",
                    "pubkey":"PW847szICqnQBzbdr5TAoGO26RwGxG95e3Vd/M+/GZc="

        }


    De/Serializing Licenses
    -----------------------

    Licenses are typically stored in files, in the configuration directory path of the application.

        import json
        # Locate, open, read
        #with config_open( "application.crypto-licencing", 'r' ) as provenance_file:
        #    provenance_ser	= provenance_file.read()
        >>> provenance_dict = json.loads( provenance_ser )

    Or use the crypto_licensing.load() API to get them all into a dict, with
    the license file basename deduced from your __package__ or __file__ name:

        import crypto_licensing as cl
        licenses		= dict( cl.load(
            filename	= __file__,
            confirm	= False, # don't check signing key validity via DKIM
        ))

    Validating Licenses
    -------------------

    Somewhere in the product's code, the License is loaded and validated.

        >>> provenance_load = LicenseSigned( confirm=False, **provenance_dict )
        >>> print( provenance_load )
        {
            "license":{
                "author":{
                    "domain":"awesome-inc.com",
                    "name":"Awesome, Inc.",
                    "product":"Awesome Tool",
                    "pubkey":"PW847szICqnQBzbdr5TAoGO26RwGxG95e3Vd/M+/GZc="
                }
            },
            "signature":"38gIOyPtcLO0EdElKQDpvUvMkm4xuVR9Ksm2P0ZaFhqo7X3p7dLZidxrNEHyvU8OrSrQA7wmpb+9xweWye8FBg=="
        }
        >>> print( json.dumps( verify( provenance_load, confirm=False, dependencies=False ), default=str ))
        {}

    Comparing License
    -----------------

    A License is considered a subset or less-than another license if:

    - it is not signed by the same author
    - it doesn't contain at least the same dependencies
    - it doesn't grant at least the same grants

        The plaintext 256-bit Ed25519 private key seed is encrypted using ChaCha20Poly1305 with the
        symmetric cipher key using the (same) salt as a Nonce.  Since the random salt is only (ever)
        used to encrypt one thing, it satisfies the requirement that the same Nonce only ever be
        used once to encrypt something using a certain key.

    - TODO: use a second Keypair's private key to derive a shared secret key

      Optionally, this Signing Keypair's derivation seed can be protected by a symmetric cipher
      key derived from the *public* key of this signing key, and the *private* key of another
      Ed25519 key using diffie-hellman.  For example, one derived via Argon2 from an email +
      password + salt.

    Thus, if a <Keypair> is found but no <LicenseSigned> can be found or assigned, the caller can

    provenance for future use.

    - Load our Ed25519 Keypair
      - Create one, if not found
    - Load our Licenses
      - Obtain one, if not found

    If an Ed25519 Agent signing authority Keypair or License must be created, the default location
    where they should be stored is in the most general configuration path location that is writable.
    We don't do that here; the caller should create one, as appropriate, and either save it (so we
    find it with load_keypairs on a subsequent call), or pass it in via keypairs.  We will load all
    available Keypairs/Licenses, and attempt to return any Licenses that are verified for any
    Keypair (ie. were issued by the Keypair, or could be sub-licensed by the Keypair, which we will
    do automatically, so the Licensee doesn't actually need to save their signed LicenseProvenance
    -- unless they wish to avoid the need to be online and "confirm" the validity of the
    sub-Licenses in the future; they can save the generated LicenseProvenance, and trust their
    signature to prove that, in the past, they agreed that the sub-License(s) were verified).

    Agent signing authority is usually machine- or username-specific: a License to run a program on
    one machine and/or for one username usually doesn't transfer to another machine/username.
    However, you can arrange for a License to have a certain client Agent Keypair, and issue a
    License for a certain Machine ID.  Later, when the client restores from backups onto a new
    machine, the License will fail to validate (b/c new Machine ID).

    However, if the issued License is specific to the client's Keypair (or the License doesn't
    specify a client public key at all), they can load their Keypair (by entering credentials), and
    re-sub-license their License for the new machine.  Thus, we'll automatically do this here, w/
    proper username/password, and return the newly sub-licensed LicenseProvenance.

    We assume that any Keypair we can load (ie. we have the username/password to access) must imply
    a signing authority.  So, don't keep generic license keypairs (ie. those used to author
    licenses, or sub-license master Licenses to clients) n the same directories (or with the same
    credentials) as those used for end-user client agents.  Otherwise, this will pick them up and
    use them to create sub-licenses!

    then looks in author.servicekey.  Any Keypairs collected are used in subsequent searches, to see
    if a License issued by the author or to the client can be refined and issued on behalf of the
    named agent.

    All Keypairs found are assumed to be client Agent keypairs useful for issuing sub-licenses: So,
    don't store author Agent keypairs in the same directories, or using the same credentials!

    Obtain any LicenseSigned provenances, and sift through them for any that authorize usage of the
    given author's domain and product, to the given client, for a certain space and time, and
    satisfying any constraints.

    If the period of authorization has expired, confirm with a license server that the LicenseSigned
    provenance is still valid (hasn't been revoked, eg. for reasons of license fraud, such as
    someone issuing the LicenseSigned provenance to clients on too many machines). A License without
    a period is never required to check the server (ie. lasts forever).

    If it can be proven that:

    1) The KeyPair belongs to the agent (unencrypted, decrypted or signed by the agent)
    2) the License is signed by the agent's KeyPair signing key (proving that the agent asked
       for it, and it was issued to the agent)
       - This indicates that the author was satisfied to authorize the client to use the resource in
         a certain space (machine) and for a certain time (period)

    4) The License contains the required capabilities
       - and were issued by the expected Author

    then the requested capability is authorized.

    Otherwise, use the agent's Keypair to obtain a License for the specified remaining capability/constraints.

    Yields the discovered sequence of KeyPair, License found, or if none found under any name,
