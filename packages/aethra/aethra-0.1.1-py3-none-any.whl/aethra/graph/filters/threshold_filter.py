class ThresholdFilter(BaseGraphFilter):
    """
    A filter that removes edges from a graph whose weights are below a specified threshold.

    Attributes:
        threshold (float): The minimum weight an edge must have to remain in the graph.

    def __init__(self, threshold: float):
        """
        Initialize the ThresholdFilter.

        Args:
            threshold (float): The minimum weight threshold for edges (0<threshold<1). 
                               Edges with weights below this value will be removed.

    def apply(self, graph: nx.DiGraph) -> nx.DiGraph:
        """
        Apply the threshold filter to a directed graph.

        This method processes a directed graph by filtering out edges whose weights
        fall below the specified threshold. The filtering operation is non-destructive,
        meaning the input graph remains unchanged, and a new filtered graph is returned.

        Args:
            graph (nx.DiGraph): 
                The directed graph to filter. Each edge in the graph is expected to have a
                'weight' attribute. The 'weight' attribute represents the strength or importance
                of the connection between two nodes.

        Returns:
            nx.DiGraph: 
                A new directed graph with the following modifications:
                    - All edges with weights below the specified threshold are removed.
                    - The structure and properties of the input graph are otherwise preserved.

        Process:
            1. The method iterates over all edges in the graph.
            2. For each edge, the 'weight' attribute is checked.
            3. If the weight is below the specified threshold, the edge is removed from the
            filtered graph.
            4. The resulting graph is returned.

        Example:
            >>> import networkx as nx
            >>> graph = nx.DiGraph()
            >>> graph.add_edge("Node A", "Node B", weight=0.5)
            >>> graph.add_edge("Node A", "Node C", weight=0.2)
            >>> graph.add_edge("Node B", "Node C", weight=0.8)
            >>> threshold_filter = ThresholdFilter(threshold=0.3)
            >>> filtered_graph = threshold_filter.apply(graph)
            >>> list(filtered_graph.edges(data=True))
            [('Node A', 'Node B', {'weight': 0.5}), ('Node B', 'Node C', {'weight': 0.8})]

        Notes:
            - The threshold value is determined when the `ThresholdFilter` object is initialized.
            - If no edges meet the threshold criteria, the resulting graph may contain nodes but no edges.
            - The method assumes that all edges in the graph have a 'weight' attribute. If the attribute
            is missing, an exception may be raised.

        Limitations:
            - This method does not modify the nodes or their attributes.
            - The filtering process only considers the 'weight' attribute. Additional criteria
            for filtering would require extending this class or method.
