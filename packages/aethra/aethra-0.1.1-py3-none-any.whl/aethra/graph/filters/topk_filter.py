    A filter that keeps only the top K edges for each node in a directed graph,

        Apply the TopK filter to a directed graph.

        This method creates a copy of the input graph and retains only the top K
        outgoing edges for each node, based on edge weights.

        Args:
            graph (nx.DiGraph): The directed graph to filter. Each edge in the graph
                                is expected to have a 'weight' attribute.

        Returns:
            nx.DiGraph: A new graph with only the top K edges per node retained.

        Example:
            >>> import networkx as nx
            >>> graph = nx.DiGraph()
            >>> graph.add_edge(0, 1, weight=0.5)
            >>> graph.add_edge(0, 2, weight=0.2)
            >>> graph.add_edge(0, 3, weight=0.8)
            >>> graph.add_edge(1, 2, weight=0.3)
            >>> filter = TopKFilter(top_k=2)
            >>> filtered_graph = filter.apply(graph)
