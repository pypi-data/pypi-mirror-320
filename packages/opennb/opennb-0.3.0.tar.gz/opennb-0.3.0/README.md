📓 Open Jupyter notebooks from GitHub repositories or URLs directly in Jupyter.
Very useful in conjunction with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/#tools).

> [!TIP]
> Try `uvx --with "pipefunc[docs]" opennb pipefunc/pipefunc/example.ipynb` to open a notebook from the [`pipefunc`](https://github.com/pipefunc/pipefunc) repository and ensure its dependencies are installed.

## Features

- 📦 Open notebooks directly from GitHub repositories
- 🔄 Automatic default branch detection
- 🌳 Support for specific branches
- 🔗 Direct URL support
- 🚀 Pass-through of Jupyter notebook arguments
- 📥 Integration with `uvx` for dependency management
- 👽 Also works with Jupytext `.md` or `.py` notebooks

## Usage

Open a notebook from a GitHub repository:

```bash
opennb owner/repo/path/to/notebook.ipynb
```

This defaults to the default branch of the repository.

Or specify a specific branch:

```bash
opennb owner/repo@branch#path/to/notebook.ipynb
```

Open directly from a URL:

```bash
opennb https://example.com/notebook.ipynb
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `opennb` is especially useful when used with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/).

Use with `uvx` to install dependencies and open a notebook in one go:

```bash
uvx --with dependency opennb owner/repo/path/to/notebook.ipynb
```

For example, to open a notebook from the `pipefunc` repository and ensure its dependencies are installed:

```bash
uvx --with "pipefunc[docs]" opennb pipefunc/pipefunc/example.ipynb
```

### Arguments

All arguments after the notebook specification are passed directly to `jupyter notebook`:

```bash
opennb owner/repo/notebook.ipynb --port 8888 --no-browser
```

## Examples

Open a notebook from the main branch:

```bash
opennb owner/repo/notebook.ipynb
```

Open from a specific branch:

```bash
opennb jupyter/notebook@main#docs/source/examples/Notebook/Notebook%20Basics.ipynb
```

Open with custom Jupyter settings:

```bash
opennb owner/repo/notebook.ipynb --NotebookApp.token='my-token'
```

## Installation

Install using pip:

```bash
pip install opennb
```

Or using [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
uv pip install opennb
```
