# deepdelineator

The `deepdelineator` library can be used to detect characteristic points in arterial blood pressure waveforms using deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of the detection. At the same time, regions with noise can be identified automatically.

## Installation
`pip install deepdelineator`

## Usage

```python
from deepdelineator.utils import load_delineator

delineator = load_delineator()
s_f = 500 # Sampling frecuency of the signals, adjust to your data
# Detection!
detections = model.pred_from_numpy(signal_list=list_of_abp_signals,s_f=s_f)
```
