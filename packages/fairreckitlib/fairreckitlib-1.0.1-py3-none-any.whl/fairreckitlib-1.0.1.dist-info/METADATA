FairRecKitLib is a library that functions as a combinatory interface between a set of existing recommender libraries, such as [LensKit](https://pypi.org/project/lenskit/), [Implicit](https://pypi.org/project/implicit/), and [Surprise](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-surprise/). It was made to accompany the [FairRecKit application (FairRecKitApp)](https://github.com/FairRecKit/FairRecKitApp).

This software has been developed by students within the Software Project course of the bachelor program Computer Science at Utrecht University, commissioned by Christine Bauer.

# Installation Requirements
FairRecKitLib utilises the scikit-surprise package, which relies on having a suitable C/C++ compiler present on the system to be able to install itself. For this purpose, make sure you have [Cython](https://pypi.org/project/Cython/) installed before attempting to install FairRecKitLib. If your system lacks a compiler, install the 'Desktop development with C++' build tools through the [Visual Studio installer](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_buildtools.exe).

Meeting these requirements, you can install FairRecKitLib like any PyPI package, using e.g. pip or conda.

**pip:**  
`pip install fairreckitlib`

**conda**  
`conda install fairreckitlib`
