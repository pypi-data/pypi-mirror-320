Constants:

    FUNK_SVD: name of the FunkSVD recommender.
    ITEM_KNN: name of the ItemKNN recommender.
    MULTI_VAE: name of the MultiVAE recommender.
    MOST_POP: name of the MostPop recommender.
    RANDOM: name of the Random recommender.
    PURE_SVD: name of the PureSVD recommender.
    SVD_PP: name of the SVDpp recommender.
    USER_KNN: name of the UserKNN recommender.

This program has been developed by students from the bachelor Computer Science at
Utrecht University within the Software Project course.
