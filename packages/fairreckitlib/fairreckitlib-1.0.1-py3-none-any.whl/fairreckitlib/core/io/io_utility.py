"""This module contains IO utility functions that connect with external packages.

Functions:

    load_array_from_hdf5: load array data from hdf5 file.
    load_json: load dictionary from json file.
    load_yml: load dictionary from yml file.
    save_array_to_hdf5: save array data to hdf5 file.
    save_json: save dictionary to json file.
    save_yml: save dictionary to yml file.

This program has been developed by students from the bachelor Computer Science at
Utrecht University within the Software Project course.
