"""This module contains IO functions that delete something on the disk and dispatch an IO event.

Functions:

    delete_dir: delete a directory, recursively, with IO event dispatching.
    delete_file: delete a file from the disk with IO event dispatching.

This program has been developed by students from the bachelor Computer Science at
Utrecht University within the Software Project course.
