"""This module tests the threading base/processor functionality.

Classes:

    DummyThread: used for testing assertions in the threading base/processor functionality.

Functions:

    test_thread_base: test the base thread interface through the dummy thread implementation.
    test_thread_processor: test the thread processor functionality using the dummy thread.

This program has been developed by students from the bachelor Computer Science at
Utrecht University within the Software Project course.
