"""This module contains IO functions that create something on the disk and dispatch an IO event.

Functions:

    create_dir: create a directory on the disk with IO event dispatching.
    create_json: create a json file on the disk with IO event dispatching.
    create_yml: create a yml file on the disk with event dispatching.

This program has been developed by students from the bachelor Computer Science at
Utrecht University within the Software Project course.
