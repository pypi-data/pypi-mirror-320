"""This module contains a model pipeline that recommends items based on rating predictions.

Classes:

    RecommendationPipeline: can batch recommendations from multiple models for a specific API.
    RecommendationPipelineCSR: recommendation pipeline with a csr matrix instead of a dataframe.

This program has been developed by students from the bachelor Computer Science at
Utrecht University within the Software Project course.
