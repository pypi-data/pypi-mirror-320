"""This module contains metric constants that are used in other modules.

Constants:

    KEY_METRIC_PARAM_K: the key that is used for the metric parameter K.
    KEY_METRIC_EVALUATION: the key that is used to identify a metric evaluation.
    KEY_METRIC_SUBGROUP: the key that is used to identify a metric subgroup.

Enumerations:

    MetricCategory: the category of evaluation for a metric.
    Metric: the names of various metrics.

This program has been developed by students from the bachelor Computer Science at
Utrecht University within the Software Project course.
