# Library of Basic Algorithms <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg" alt="MIT-License image"></a>

This repository contains a small library called `BasicAlgorithms`, a collection of basic algorithms implemented in Python. The 'BasicAlgorithms` library this is a cozy place for the most common algorithms.

## Enabled Algorithms

Currently, the library includes implementations of the following algorithms:

- Sorting:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
    - Selection Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Search:
- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Mathematical algorithms:
    - Factorial
    - The Fibonacci number of the index
- Other algorithms:
    - Search for min and max 

## Usage

To use algorithms in your Python projects, you can:

1. Clone the repository.


## Contribution

Any contributions are welcome! If you have an implementation of another algorithm or would like to improve the existing ones, please follow these steps.:

1. Make a fork of the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Implement your changes.
4. Make sure that your code is well documented and includes tests.
5. Send a pull request.
